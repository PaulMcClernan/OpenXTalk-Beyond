# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security problems privately, not in a public issue.

Use GitHub's private reporting form:
<https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/security/advisories/new>
(you need to be signed in to GitHub). Only the maintainers can see the
report. GitHub's documentation explains
[how private reporting works](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

At the time of writing, private reporting has not been turned on for
this repository yet, so the form may say that it is not available. In
that case, open an ordinary
[issue](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/issues) that says
only that you have a security report and would like a private way to
send it. Do not include any details of the problem in that issue. A
maintainer can then open a draft security advisory, which only the
maintainers and the people added to it can see, and
[add you to it](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/adding-a-collaborator-to-a-repository-security-advisory)
so that you can send the details there.

Please include:

- the OXT-Beyond version and build number (the version is in the title
  of the menubar window, for example "OXT-Beyond 0.2.4", and in
  `ide/.version` of a source checkout; the build number is under
  *Preferences > Automatic Updates*), and your operating system and
  version (Windows; macOS, Apple Silicon or Intel; or your Linux
  distribution);
- which package you use (the installer or the portable zip on Windows,
  the disk image or the app zip on macOS, the Linux tar.xz run in place
  or installed with `install.sh`);
- what an attacker can do, and what they need first (for example, "a
  user opens a crafted stack file");
- steps or a small stack or script that shows the problem.

This is a small volunteer project. There is no bug bounty and no
guaranteed response time, but reports will be read and answered as soon
as possible. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix a problem
before you publish details.

Problems in OpenXTalk Lite itself, in LiveCode or in the OpenXTalk
forums' own software are outside this project; report those to their
maintainers.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release, and the `main` branch, get fixes. A
pre-release (a release candidate such as 0.2.1-rc.1) is for testing: it
gets no fixes of its own, and the next pre-release or release replaces
it.

## Downloads and signatures

The Windows binaries (the installer, `OXT-Beyond.exe` and the other
programs and libraries) are **not code-signed**, so Windows SmartScreen
may warn about them. The macOS app is **signed ad hoc**, with a
signature that lets macOS check that the app's files are intact but
names no Apple Developer ID, and it is not notarized by Apple, so macOS
blocks it until you allow it (see the README's macOS section). The Linux package is not signed. Download
them only from this repository's
[Releases page](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases)
and check them against the `SHA256SUMS` file of the same release, which
lists every file of the release, for example:

```bat
certutil -hashfile OXT-Beyond-0.1.0-win-x86_64-setup.exe SHA256
```

On macOS, `shasum -a 256 <file>`; on Linux, in the folder with the
download and `SHA256SUMS`, `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`.

Development builds (workflow artifacts on the Actions tab) are made by
the same workflows but are not reviewed as releases.

The standalone runtimes for the other platforms in each package come
from a release asset of this repository (`runtimes-0.2.4-rc.7`), which
the packager downloads and refuses unless its SHA-256 matches the one
recorded in
[`tools/oxt/external-assets.json`](tools/oxt/external-assets.json). The
Windows and Linux runtimes in it are built from this repository by its
CI, with the same libraries as the packages themselves. The Android
runtime in it is not: it is OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's, taken unchanged
(LiveCode 9.6.3 builds and files as Tom Perry shipped them), and has
not been rebuilt or updated. See
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#standalone-runtimes-for-other-platforms).

## Updates

OXT-Beyond's update check (*Help > Check for Updates*, and the
automatic check if you turn it on in *Preferences > Automatic Updates*;
it is off by default):

- asks GitHub's API (`api.github.com`) over HTTPS for this repository's
  latest release, and for the list of its releases when the latest one
  is not an OXT-Beyond version (for example `prebuilts-v1`) or when you
  run a pre-release, and reads the version number (the release's `v`
  tag), name and notes from the answer; pre-releases are offered only
  to people who already run a pre-release;
- identifies itself to GitHub as OXT-Beyond with its version number
  (the User-Agent header), and sends nothing else about you or your
  computer beyond what any web request carries (such as your IP
  address);
- if the release is newer than yours, shows its notes and a button that
  opens the release page on github.com in your browser, and does nothing
  else;
- never downloads, installs or runs anything, never writes into the
  program folder and never asks for administrator rights;
- never contacts OpenXTalk Lite's update servers (tsites.co.uk,
  openxtalk.net).

You update by downloading the new installer, disk image or archive from
the Releases page yourself and checking it as described above.

OpenXTalk Lite's own updater worked differently: it downloaded IDE
files from Tom Perry's servers and copied them into the program folder
with a script run with administrator rights. OXT-Beyond does not use
it. Its stack (`Toolset/palettes/updates/updates.livecode`) is still in
the program folder, unchanged, because binary stacks were not re-saved
for this release, but the IDE no longer opens it.

Some *Help* menu items open web pages in your browser, for example the
OpenXTalk forums (openxtalk.org) and *Dictionary Online* (openxtalk.net).
They are ordinary links; nothing is downloaded into OXT-Beyond.

## Known issues in bundled components

OpenSSL, curl and ICU are current releases, built from source for all
three platforms (from 0.2.1-rc.3 on; before, the builds used the
versions LiveCode Community last shipped):

| Component | Version in this build | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSSL | 3.5.9 (September 2026) | The 3.5 series is a long-term support release, supported until April 2030 ([release strategy](https://openssl-library.org/policies/releasestrat/)). Earlier releases of OXT-Beyond shipped 1.1.1g on Windows and 1.1.1w on Linux and macOS; the 1.1.1 series reached end of life in September 2023. |
| curl (libcurl) | 8.22.0 (September 2026) | Current; see curl's [vulnerability table](https://curl.se/docs/vulnerabilities.html). Used by the server engine (on macOS the server engine uses the system's libcurl). Earlier releases had 7.51.0 (2016). |
| ICU | 78.3 (March 2026) | Current. Earlier releases had 58.2 (2016). |
| zlib | 1.3.2 (February 2026) | Current. Earlier releases had 1.2.8 (2013). |
| libpng | 1.6.59 (September 2026) | Current. Earlier releases had 1.6.26 (2016). |
| giflib | 5.2.2 (February 2024) | The current release of the 5.x series, whose interface the engine uses. Earlier releases had 5.1.4 (2016). |
| libjpeg (IJG) | 9f (January 2024) | Current. Earlier releases had 9b (2016). |
| PCRE | 8.45 (June 2021) | The last release of PCRE 1, which is no longer maintained (its successor, PCRE2, has another interface); it has the fixes for the published vulnerabilities of PCRE 1. Earlier releases had 8.39 (2016). |

These are still old and have publicly known vulnerabilities:

| Component | Version in this build | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CEF / Chromium | CEF 74.1.19, Chromium 74.0.3729.157 (2019) | Years of unpatched browser vulnerabilities. Used by the browser widget and revBrowser on Windows and Linux. Do not use them to display content you do not trust. |
| MySQL Connector/C | 6.0.0 | Old client library used by the MySQL database driver. It speaks TLS 1.0 only, which OpenSSL 3 refuses, so its encrypted connections fail. |
| libpq (PostgreSQL) | from PostgreSQL 9.4.5 (2015) | Old client library used by the PostgreSQL database driver. |

Other libraries in `thirdparty/` (libxml2 2.9.4, libxslt, libzip,
cairo 1.9.4 and others) are also several years old. SQLite was updated
to 3.51.1.

Upgrading these libraries is planned. Until then, treat the browser
components and any network or file-parsing features as unsafe for
untrusted input. [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) lists
every bundled component.

Stacks are programs: opening a stack can run its scripts. Only open
stacks from sources you trust.
