# Contributing to OXT-Beyond

Thank you for helping. Bug reports, fixes, documentation, testing on
different Windows, macOS and Linux setups and work on the plans listed
in the
[README](README.md#known-limitations-and-plans) are all welcome.

This project is small and run by volunteers. Please be patient with
reviews, and be kind to each other.

## Licence of contributions

There is **no contributor licence agreement** (CLA). LiveCode Ltd needed
one because it also sold LiveCode under a commercial licence; this
project does not.

By opening a pull request you agree that your contribution is licensed
under the GNU General Public License version 3 ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) with
the same additional permission to combine the code with OpenSSL and
Microsoft ATL that LiveCode Ltd granted
([LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md)). Only contribute work you
have the right to contribute. If you bring in work by someone else (for
example from an OpenXTalk forum post), say so in the pull request, with
its author, source and licence.

Commits do not need a `Signed-off-by` line.

## Before you start

- For anything bigger than a small fix, open an
  [issue](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/issues) first to
  talk about the idea. It saves work on both sides.
- Read [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) and get a local build working. Changes
  to the engine, externals or build files need to be built and tried
  before review. Changes to IDE scripts can be tried on Windows with a
  downloaded `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-binaries.zip` extracted
  into your clone, but the IDE compile check and packaging need
  Python 3.
- This project builds, packages and tests Windows x86-64, macOS (one
  universal app for Apple Silicon and Intel) and Linux x86-64, and
  builds Linux arm64 without packaging it. Code for other platforms
  (iOS, Android and others) is still in the tree; try not to break it,
  but CI does not build it. The Linux and macOS builds run in CI (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#12-building-on-linux), sections 12 and 13),
  so the checks of a pull request build and test a change on all three
  platforms.

## Keeping old stacks working

Compatibility with existing stacks comes first, and a change that
breaks them is not merged. Stacks made with earlier releases, and with
the LiveCode and OpenXTalk versions this project comes from, must keep
opening, and old syntax must keep giving the results it gave before.
This holds for the engine, the externals, the IDE and the stack file
format.

- If a change could alter what a script sees, run the scripts it
  touches on the latest release and on your build, and compare the
  results. For a change to an external alone, the released engine can
  run with the old external and then the new one: pull request #81 did
  this for its library updates, running about 1,800 scripts on the
  released 0.2.4 engine with 0.2.4's externals and with its own.
- Add new behaviour under new syntax or an option, not by changing what
  existing syntax does.
- When a fix has to change behaviour (a crash, a security hole), keep
  the old result wherever it can be kept, and list each difference that
  remains in the pull request and in the README's notes for the
  release.
- If something cannot be done without breaking old stacks, open an
  issue and ask before writing it.

## Branches and pull requests

- `main` is the only long-lived branch. Releases are tags on `main`
  (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#10-making-a-release)).
- Work on a feature branch in your fork (or, for maintainers, in this
  repository) with a short descriptive name, for example
  `fix-dark-mode-menus` or `docs-building`.
- Open a pull request against `main` and fill in the template.
- The checks of the three build workflows must pass before a pull
  request is merged: "Build win-x86_64"; "Build linux-x86_64", "Build
  linux-arm64" and "Package linux-x86_64"; "Build mac-arm64", "Build
  mac-x86_64", "Package mac-universal", "Test mac-universal (arm64)" and
  "Test mac-universal (x86_64)". If one fails, the log artifacts of its
  run help: `build-logs-win-x86_64` (`msbuild.log` and the logs of
  packaging, the smoke test, the IDE compile check, the engine tests,
  and the installer test), `build-logs-linux-<arch>`
  and `build-logs-mac-<arch>` (uploaded when a build fails),
  `package-logs-linux-x86_64`, `package-logs-mac-universal` and
  `test-logs-mac-universal-<arch>`.
- Keep each pull request to one change, or a few closely related ones.
  Update it by pushing more commits.

### How pull requests are merged

- **Ordinary changes** may be merged with "Squash and merge", which
  turns the pull request into one commit on `main`.
- **Pull requests that carry imported history must be merged with
  "Create a merge commit".** Never squash or rebase them. This applies
  to every pull request whose commits record other people's work with
  its original authors and dates, such as the OpenXTalk Lite IDE history
  (commits authored by Terry Little and Tom Perry), a future import of a
  newer OpenXTalk Lite, xTalk Suite or upstream LiveCode change, or any
  other history taken over from another repository. Squashing would
  replace those authors and dates with the maintainer's and lose the
  per-version commits; rebasing would rewrite every commit. Say in the
  pull request description that it carries imported history.

The upstream LiveCode branch model (`develop`, `develop-X.Y`,
`release-X.Y`, described in `docs/development/release_branching_policy.md`)
does not apply here.

## Commit messages

```text
Short summary of the change (about 72 characters at most)

A longer explanation of what the change does and why, wrapped at about
72 characters. Mention anything a reviewer would not guess from the
diff: alternatives you tried, things you could not test, follow-up
work.

Fixes #123
```

- Write the summary in the imperative ("Fix crash when ...", not "Fixed"
  or "Fixes").
- Refer to GitHub issues as `#N`. Writing `Fixes #N` in the commit message
  or pull request description closes the issue when the change is merged.
- Old commits use tags such as `[[ Bug 12345 ]]`, which refer to LiveCode
  Ltd's bug tracker (quality.livecode.com). Do not use them for new work.
- A commit that changes a binary stack without a patch file must say
  what changed in it (see [below](#binary-stacks)), because Git cannot
  show it.

## Coding style

Follow the style of the file you are editing (including tabs or spaces
and line endings). For new code, the upstream guides still apply:

- C++: [C++ coding style](docs/development/C++-style.md) and
  [use of C++ language features](docs/development/C++-features.md). The
  engine is built with the Visual Studio 2017 (v141) compiler, so do not
  use language features it does not support.
- LiveCode Builder:
  [Builder Style Guide](docs/guides/Builder%20Style%20Guide.md).
- LiveCode script in the IDE: keep the style of the surrounding script.
  Mark changes to inherited scripts with a comment that starts with
  `-- OXT-Beyond:` and says why. Keep the existing dated comments, such
  as Tom Perry's `(tperry 28-6-24)` and Terry Little's; they are the
  record of their changes.
- Python (`tools/oxt/`, `tools/ci/`): Python 3.8 or later, standard
  library only, working on Windows, Linux and macOS.
- PowerShell (`tools/ci/`): must run in both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and
  PowerShell 7, with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, and must check
  `$LASTEXITCODE` after running programs.
- Documentation: [docs/contributing_to_docs.md](docs/contributing_to_docs.md)
  describes the dictionary and guide formats. Its parts about LiveCode's
  CLA, build servers and bug tracker do not apply here.
- Batch and command files (`*.bat`, `*.cmd`) are checked out with
  Windows (CRLF) line endings; keep them that way. Shell scripts
  (`*.sh`, `*.inc`) must use Unix (LF) line endings.

Please do not reformat code you are not otherwise changing; it makes
the real change hard to review.

## Changing the IDE

The IDE is in `ide/` (and 11 libraries in `ide-support/`). Much of it is
stored in binary stacks (`*.livecode`, `*.rev`, `*.oxtstack`), which Git
can store but not diff or merge.

### Prefer script-only stacks

- Put new IDE code in script-only stacks (`*.livecodescript`), for
  example a new library in `ide/Toolset/libraries/`, rather than in a
  binary stack. They can be reviewed, diffed and merged like any other
  text file.
- When you need to change a script that lives inside a binary stack,
  consider moving it into a script-only stack first (for example as a
  behavior), in its own commit.

### Binary stacks

- Change the scripts and properties of objects in binary stacks with a
  patch file in `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches/`, applied with
  `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.sh`, and commit the patch file together
  with the stack it changes (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#11-working-on-the-ide)). The patch is the
  reviewable record of the change, and CI checks that every patch is
  applied.
- Do not open and save binary stacks you do not intend to change.
  Saving rewrites the whole file (and can change its stack format
  version and the paths stored in it), even if you changed nothing.
- A change that a patch cannot express (adding or deleting objects, for
  example) is made with the IDE built from this repository, run from
  your clone, so that the stack is saved by the engine this project
  ships. Keep it in its own commit, and say in the commit message which
  objects, properties or scripts changed and why.
- Do not remove other people's credits or dated comments from stacks.
- The "OpenXTalk Lite" text that is still inside binary stacks will be
  changed in reviewable steps like these; please coordinate in an issue
  before changing many stacks at once.

### Check your change

- Run the IDE from your clone and try the part you changed.
- Run the IDE compile check (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#ide-compile-check)). It compiles every
  script, including the object scripts inside binary stacks, and fails
  on errors that are not in `tools/ci/ide-compile-baseline.txt`. If your
  change fixes a known error, remove its line from the baseline in the
  same pull request.
- If you changed anything that runs at start-up, packaging or the
  installer, also try the packaged or installed program.

### Tom Perry's plugin

`ide/Extensions/community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite` carries Tom Perry's
notice, which must stay with the plugin unaltered. Do not edit its
header; see
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#tom-perrys-notice-for-communityopenxtalkpluginoxtlite).

## Importing from other projects

- **OpenXTalk Lite or other installed IDEs.**
  [`tools/oxt/layout.py`](tools/oxt/README.md) classifies the files of an
  installed OpenXTalk Lite (or LiveCode) folder, imports its IDE files
  into `ide/` and `ide-support/`, and verifies the result. Use it for any
  future import, in a branch of its own: one commit per upstream version,
  with the original author and date, a message that names the sources
  and credits the people involved, and a merge commit (see
  [above](#how-pull-requests-are-merged)). Record what was left out and
  why.
- **Binaries this repository does not build** are not committed. The
  runtimes for other platforms are listed in
  [`tools/oxt/external-assets.json`](tools/oxt/external-assets.json) with
  a URL, size and SHA-256 (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#external-assets)), and the extensions of the
  xTalk Suite are pinned to commits of their own repositories in
  [`tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json`](tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json)
  (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#xtalk-suite-extensions)). The packager
  adds both.
- Every import must come with its licence: update
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), and leave out files
  whose terms do not allow redistribution (as `layout.py` does with the
  files it classes "excluded").

## What not to commit

Build output and downloaded files: `build-win-x86_64/`,
`win-x86_64-bin/`, `build-linux-<arch>/`, `linux-<arch>-bin/`,
`build-mac/`, `_build/`, `prebuilt/fetched/`, `prebuilt/unpacked/`,
`prebuilt/fetched-assets/`, `prebuilt/packaged/` and `dist/`. Most are
already ignored by Git.
Never commit hand-edited files from `build-win-x86_64`; change the
`*.gyp` or `*.gypi` files and run `config.py` again.

Generated documentation, which Git ignores: LiveCode's Dictionary, the
guides and the text dictionary in
`ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data`, written by
`tools/ci/build_docs.sh` and by the IDE when you run it from your
clone. Change their sources instead: the `.lcdoc` files in
`docs/`, the documentation comments of the code, and the guides in
`docs/guides` and `ide/Documentation/guides` (see BUILDING.md,
[Documentation](BUILDING.md#documentation)).

`debug_syms_inputs.txt` in the repository root is different: configuring
rewrites it, but it is tracked by Git (it came with Tom Perry's
changes). If it shows up as modified, restore it with
`git checkout -- debug_syms_inputs.txt` rather than committing the
change with unrelated work.

`ide/.buildnumber` holds the placeholder `0`; do not commit a real
build number (packaging writes it).

## Third-party code

`thirdparty/` holds the sources of the third-party libraries. Most of
them are not compiled by the normal build: the engine links the static
libraries of the "Thirdparty" prebuilt archive, which every platform
builds from `thirdparty/` beforehand (CI rebuilds it whenever
`thirdparty/` changes; on your own Windows machine, run
`prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1 -Libraries Thirdparty` again). See
[thirdparty/README.md](thirdparty/README.md) and the "Prebuilt libraries"
section of [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#6-prebuilt-libraries).

When you add or update third-party code, content or an external asset,
update [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) and keep the
licence file in the tree (or in the asset).

## Testing

Say in your pull request how you tested the change. Depending on what
you changed:

- build Release x64 with `make.cmd` (BUILDING.md, section 5);
- run the IDE from your clone (`win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe`)
  and try the part you changed;
- run `tools\ci\verify-build.ps1` and `tools\ci\smoke-test.ps1` if you
  changed the engine, externals or build;
- run `tools\ci\package-windows.ps1` and `tools\ci\ide-compile-check.ps1`
  if you changed the IDE or packaging;
- run `tools\ci\build-installer.ps1` and `tools\ci\test-installer.ps1` if
  you changed the installer;
- on Linux or macOS, run `python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py`
  (`smoke` and `compile`), and the checks of the
  [Linux package](BUILDING.md#linux-package) or the
  [macOS app](BUILDING.md#macos-app), if you changed something that
  works differently there;
- run the engine tests of `tests/` with
  `tools/ci/run_engine_tests.py` (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#engine-tests)) if you changed the engine,
  the toolchain or a test; `--filter` runs only the tests whose name
  matches;
- run the IDE lint checks (`python tools/ci/check_ide_colour_literals.py`,
  `check_ide_stacks.py`, `check_ide_icons.py`, `check_se_schemes.py` and
  `check_ide_prefs.py`) if you changed the IDE; they need no build.

CI runs all of these on every pull request. The C++ unit tests
(`cmd /c ..\make.cmd check`) have not been set up for this project yet;
help with that is welcome.

## Release notes

Releases use GitHub's generated release notes, which list the merged
pull requests, after a description written by the release workflow
(`tools/ci/release_notes.py`: what the release is, which file to
download on each platform, what each platform needs, and how to check
the downloads). Give your pull request a title that makes sense in that
list, and describe any change users will notice in its description. The
fragments in `docs/notes/` are upstream LiveCode release notes; do not
add new ones there. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists every commit
since Tom Perry's last one, under the release that included it; the
maintainer adds a release's section in the pull request that sets its
version (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#10-making-a-release)), so you do
not need to edit it. [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) records the history up to
OXT-Beyond 0.0.1.

## Reporting bugs

Use the [issue forms](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/issues/new/choose)
for bugs, build problems and feature requests. Report security problems
privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). For general
questions about xTalk programming, the
[OpenXTalk forums](https://openxtalk.org/forum/) are a good place to
ask.
