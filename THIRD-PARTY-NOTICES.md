## Prebuilt libraries

OpenSSL, curl and ICU are built from their source releases (the
versions in `prebuilt/versions/`) for every platform, by the CI
workflows (`prebuilt/build-libraries-windows.ps1` on Windows,
`prebuilt/build-libraries.sh` on Linux and macOS). CEF is not
compiled: the Windows (x86-64 and x86) and Linux x86-64 workflows
repackage Spotify's CEF binary distributions
(`cef-builds.spotifycdn.com`), checked against the SHA-1 that Spotify
publishes for each file (pinned in `prebuilt/cef-sha1sums`). Until
0.2.1-rc.2, Windows used LiveCode Ltd's archive of the same CEF
version, mirrored in the
[`prebuilts-v1` release](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases/tag/prebuilts-v1).
The licence texts of OpenSSL, curl and ICU are in the IDE's notice file
(see [The IDE's own notice file](#the-ides-own-notice-file)), which the
packages install.

## Libraries built from `thirdparty/`

The "Thirdparty" prebuilt archive holds static libraries that every
platform's build compiles from the `thirdparty/` tree (upstream
`livecode-thirdparty` at commit
`e5e050573c226f60acfbb9107c2b4aea853b0cbe`, now vendored in this
repository; on Windows from 0.2.1-rc.3 on, before which it was LiveCode
Ltd's archive of the same sources). A few pieces, such as the CEF C++
wrapper, are compiled from `thirdparty/` during the normal build
instead. Either way the source and, where upstream provided it, the
licence text are in `thirdparty/`.

## The IDE

The IDE in `ide/` (installed as `Toolset/`, `Plugins/`, `Resources/`,
`Documentation/` and `Extensions/`) is the OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 IDE with
OXT-Beyond's changes; [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) describes where it came
from.

### OpenXTalk Lite's changes to the LiveCode IDE

The LiveCode Community IDE is Copyright © LiveCode Ltd and licensed
under the GPLv3. OpenXTalk Lite changed and extended it: Terry Little
(from September 2023), Tom Perry (from September 2023 to 1.15), Paul
McClernan and other OpenXTalk forum members (see the
[README credits](README.md#credits)). These changes came to this
repository as installed files, without a separate licence statement.
Tom Perry has said on the OpenXTalk forums that OpenXTalk Lite remains
under LiveCode Community's licence, the GPLv3, and OXT-Beyond
distributes the IDE on that basis. Whether their changes also carry
LiveCode Ltd's permission to combine the code with OpenSSL and ATL has
not been confirmed; see [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md).

### Code adapted from HyperXTalk

[HyperXTalk](https://github.com/emily-elizabeth/HyperXTalk), by
Emily-Elizabeth Howard and contributors (docmeth02, Mark Wieder, Brian
Milby, Paul McClernan, BerndN and others), is another fork of LiveCode
Community, licensed under the GPLv3 (without LiveCode Ltd's ATL/OpenSSL
permission; see [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md)). Code
adapted from it keeps its authors: each OXT-Beyond commit that takes code
from HyperXTalk names the HyperXTalk commit and carries a
`Co-authored-by` line for its author. Some HyperXTalk commits were written
with an AI assistant; they say so in their own messages.

Parts of the IDE that have their own author or terms are listed below.

### Extensions shipped with the IDE

These are in `ide/Extensions/` and are installed in `Extensions/`.
The `<license>community</license>` element in their `manifest.xml`
files is not a licence statement: `lc-compile` writes it into every
manifest it generates
([`toolchain/lc-compile/src/generate.g`](toolchain/lc-compile/src/generate.g)).
The same goes for the xTalk Suite extensions, which are also installed
in `Extensions/` and are listed in their own
[section](#xtalk-suite-extensions).

| Extension | Author | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite` (OXT Lite Custom Functions, `OXTLiteFunctions.livecodescript`, version 0.0.1, February 2024) | Tom Perry (manifest author "OpenXTalk") | Tom Perry's own notice, with a condition; quoted in full [below](#tom-perrys-notice-for-communityopenxtalkpluginoxtlite). |
| `community.ferruslogic.plugin.devguides` (DevGuides, manifest version 1.0.2, header version 1.0.6, August 2021): alignment guides while dragging objects | FerrusLogic Team ("( c ) FerrusLogic Team" in the header); changed by Tom Perry to be a preference | No licence text is included; only the copyright line and the manifest's "community" element. See [Still to review](#still-to-review). |
| `org.openxtalk.library.macosnativeapptools` (Openxtalk.org macOS Native Tools, version 1.0.2), with the sample stack `samples/MacOS-Native-Tools-Tester.oxtstack`; macOS only | Paul McClernan | MIT, according to the library's documentation comment ("This library is MIT licensed"). The MIT licence text itself is not included. |
| `com.livecode.widget.calendar` (Calendar, 1.0.0) and `com.livecode.widget.piechart` (Pie Chart, 1.0.0), sources `calendar.lcb`, `calendar-support.lcb` and `pieChart.lcb` with compiled modules | Manifest author "LiveCode"; added to OpenXTalk Lite by Terry Little (Pie Chart in .9, both widgets in 1.11) | The sources have no copyright or licence header, and where they were obtained is not recorded. They are not part of LiveCode Community's `extensions/` tree. See [Still to review](#still-to-review). |

#### Tom Perry's notice for `community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite`

The header of
[`ide/Extensions/community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite/OXTLiteFunctions.livecodescript`](ide/Extensions/community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite/OXTLiteFunctions.livecodescript)
reads, exactly:

```text
/*
* OXT Lite Custom Functions
* No copyright. This is free. There's only one stipulation*
* Feb 2024
* version 0.0.1
*
* This code is intended to provide extra functions to OpenXTalk / OpenXTalk Lite.
* This should be considered free to use by anyone, however there is one stipulation / condition:
* This code should in no part be used in any LiveCode product, or fork bearing the LiveCode product name. This stipulation cannot be modified or altered, and this notice MUST go with this plugin unaltered.
*/
```

OXT-Beyond ships the plugin with this notice unaltered. OXT-Beyond is
not a LiveCode product and is not named after LiveCode. If you reuse
this plugin, or OXT-Beyond as a whole, you must respect the condition
too: do not use the plugin in a LiveCode product or in a fork that bears
the LiveCode product name, and keep the notice with it unchanged. Do
not edit this header when changing the plugin.

### Plugins

These are in `ide/Plugins/` and are installed in `Plugins/`.

| Plugin | Author | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Quick Dictionary.livecode` (v1.4) | Terry Little; concept and some SQLite code from MaxDictionary by MaxV; changes by Tom Perry (2024) | GPL version 3 or later, stated in the stack's script |
| `Report Builder.livecode` (v1.3) | Terry Little; changes by Tom Perry | GPL version 3 or later, stated in the stack's script |
| `App Browser.livecode` | LiveCode Ltd's Application Browser (`revapplicationoverview`), renamed and changed for OpenXTalk Lite by Terry Little, Tom Perry and Axwald | GPLv3, as part of the LiveCode Community IDE |

### Guides, dictionary and lessons

| Component | Where | Origin and terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User Guide and Data Grid Guide (PDF) | `ide/Documentation/PDF/` | Terry Little's debranded versions of LiveCode's User Guide and Data Grid guide. LiveCode's guides are part of LiveCode Community (GPLv3). No separate licence statement. |
| Guides in Markdown | `ide/Documentation/guides/`, `docs/guides/` | Debranded copies of LiveCode Community's guides (GPLv3), dated 2022, apparently from the earlier OpenXTalk debranding work. |
| Dictionary and guide data | `ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data/` (`api/api.sqlite`, `api_livecode_*/`, `guide/`), generated by `tools/ci/build_docs.sh` and not kept in Git | Generated in each build from LiveCode Community's dictionary sources in `docs/` (GPLv3), debranded by the OpenXTalk community and OXT-Beyond, the guides above, and the documentation of the libraries and extensions OXT-Beyond ships. |
| Plain-text dictionary exports | `ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data/api/exports/` (about 3,900 files), generated by `tools/oxt/text_dictionary.py` and not kept in Git, except the entries of `exports/xtalk/plugins` | Generated from that data for Tom Perry's dictionary stack (`oxt_dictionary.oxtstack`). |
| "All Guides" and lessons stacks | `ide/Toolset/palettes/userguides/` | Tom Perry's stacks, collecting LiveCode's guides and lessons with Terry Little's and Paul McClernan's lessons. |
| Linked files | `ide/Documentation/linked_files/` | Sample stacks, zip archives and texts that the guides and lessons refer to, mostly from LiveCode's lessons, samples and newsletter articles (for example the data grid samples and the project environments for writing externals). Their terms are not recorded; see [Still to review](#still-to-review). |

| Example stacks | `ide/Resources/Examples/` | The examples OpenXTalk Lite added in place of LiveCode's samplers: among them Terry Little's Animate Letter, DataGrid Table and Text To Image and his demo stacks (*Help > Demos*), a Video Player example (1.15), and LiveCode's Data Grid Tour and SQLite Tour, "edited and debranded for open source as requested by LiveCode Ltd." according to their text. The authors of the other examples are not recorded. |
| `neville-segments.mp4` | `ide/Resources/Examples/` | A video file shipped with the examples. Its author and licence are not recorded; see [Still to review](#still-to-review). |
| Remastered examples | `ide/Resources/Examples/Remastered/`, built by `tools/examples/` | OXT-Beyond's remakes of examples above, in Learn's look, each beside its original, which stays as it was. A remaster keeps its original's programs, comments, credits, pictures and sounds, and is under its original's terms: Terry Little's Quick Start, Animate Letter and DataGrid Table state the GPL version 3 or later; LiveCode Ltd's Data Grid Tour and SQLite Tour and the Start Center's Balls, BookLibrary and balloon samples are LiveCode Community's (GPLv3); RSS Demo (its script says "via theotherbassist, April 2016"), Scroll Image, Video Player, SQLite Book Library and the two Zip demos (remastered as one, Zip Archives) record no author or terms (see [Still to review](#still-to-review)). What OXT-Beyond added (the window, the new cards and programs, the builders) is under the GPLv3, as the rest of the IDE. |
| `oxt-respring.zip` | `ide/Resources/MacOs/` | Tom Perry's macOS helper application (an AppleScript applet) that restarts the IDE after an update on macOS. Not used on Windows. |
| `Default Preferences/livecode7.rev` | `ide/Resources/` | A preferences template from OpenXTalk Lite's installer. |
| The rest of `ide/Resources/` (Start Center, object library, mobile examples, sample icons) | | LiveCode Community's (GPLv3). |

### The IDE's own notice file

The IDE ships the notice file it inherited from LiveCode Community,
[`ide/Open Source Licenses.txt`](ide/Open%20Source%20Licenses.txt)
(installed at the root of the program folder). It covers bsdiff, curl
(8.22.0's licence), FreeType, giflib, cairo (MPL), ICU (78.3's licence,
with the notices of its data), iODBC, libjpeg, bzip2, libpng, libxml2,
libzip, OpenSSL (3.5.9's licence, the Apache License 2.0), PCRE,
PostgreSQL, Skia, sqlitedataset, zlib, WebKit and the merg externals. It
does not cover CEF/Chromium, ANGLE, SwiftShader, libffi, libxslt, MySQL
Connector/C or the components listed in this section; those are listed
in this file.

### The OXT-Beyond icon

The OXT-Beyond icon and artwork from 0.2.1 "Frankenstein" and 0.2.7
"Bug Hunt" (`ide/OXT-Beyond.ico`,
`engine/rsrc/oxt-beyond.ico`, the images in `Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/`,
the macOS app's `OXT-Beyond.icns`, which packaging makes from them, the
splash screens and the icon images in `ide/Toolset/palettes/revgeneralicons.rev`)
were drawn for OXT-Beyond by
[`Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/draw_branding.py`](Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/draw_branding.py)
and are covered by the GNU General Public License version 3, like the
rest of OXT-Beyond. Releases up to 0.2.1-rc.6 used an icon adapted from
Tom Perry's OpenXTalk Lite icon (`ide/OpenXTalk-lite_1024.ico`,
introduced in OpenXTalk Lite 1.04), which is still distributed as part
of the IDE, on the same basis as the rest of OpenXTalk Lite's changes
(above).

### The web IDE's icons

The icons of the web IDE's toolbar
(`ide/Toolset/palettes/menubar/images-web/`) are drawn from
[Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (lucide-static 0.469.0), under the ISC
License: "Copyright (c) for portions of Lucide are held by Cole Bemis
2013-2022 as part of Feather (MIT). All other copyright (c) for Lucide
are held by Lucide Contributors 2022." The licence's full text is in that
folder's [`README.md`](ide/Toolset/palettes/menubar/images-web/README.md),
which lists the icons used.

Home, the web IDE's welcome stack
([`ide/Toolset/palettes/web home/revwebhome.livecodescript`](ide/Toolset/palettes/web%20home/revwebhome.livecodescript)),
draws 25 Lucide icons of the same version, under the same licence, from
their SVG text, which its script carries with the licence's full text.

Learn, the IDE's window for the lessons, the guides and the examples
([`ide/Toolset/palettes/learn/`](ide/Toolset/palettes/learn/)), draws 90
Lucide icons of the same version, under the same licence, from their SVG
text, which its kit (`revlearnkit.livecodescript`) carries with the
licence's full text. xTalk Chat
([`ide/Extensions/org.openxtalk.plugin.xtalkchat/`](ide/Extensions/org.openxtalk.plugin.xtalkchat/))
draws its icons with the same kit.

The remastered examples
([`ide/Resources/Examples/Remastered/`](ide/Resources/Examples/Remastered/))
draw Learn's icons and 56 more of the same version, under the same
licence, from their SVG text, which the builders in
[`tools/examples/`](tools/examples/) carry;
`tools/examples/builder.livecodescript` carries the licence's full text.
Two of those, `play-solid` and `pause-solid`, are Lucide's play and
pause, filled. Play a Video also draws `stop-solid`, a plain filled
square that is not Lucide's.

## xTalk Suite extensions

The packages include fifteen extensions of the xTalk Suite by Seth
Morrow Software, in `Extensions/`: six LiveCode Builder libraries with
native code and nine LiveCode Script libraries. They are not kept in
this repository.
[`tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py`](tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py) takes
them from their own repositories on GitHub
(`SethMorrowSoftware/<repository>`) at the commits pinned in
[`tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json`](tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json),
checks every file against the SHA-256 recorded there, compiles the LCB
sources with OXT-Beyond's `lc-compile`, gives the script libraries a
`script "<name>"` first line where they have none and an
`extensionInitialize` / `extensionFinalize` pair at the end, and ships
everything else unchanged. `Extensions/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt` lists each
extension with its repository and commit. The native libraries
(`code/<platform>/` in each LCB extension, for Windows x86-64 and x86,
Linux x86-64 and x86, and macOS) are the prebuilt binaries committed to
the member repositories, which build them from the sources there; this
repository does not rebuild them. The source of each member's own code,
including its native shim, is in its repository at the pinned commit.

Every extension folder has a `licenses/` folder with its member's
licence files, which hold the full licence texts of the components
below.

Notes:

- **OpenSSL 3.** `torrentxt` and `datachannelxt` link OpenSSL 3
  statically: OpenSSL is Copyright © 1998-2026 The OpenSSL Project
  Authors and © 1995-1998 Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson, and is
  licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which asks for a copy of the
  licence to go with the binaries. The members' own licence files do not
  include it (DataChannelXT's `LICENSE` and `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` even
  say that OpenSSL is not bundled, which is true only of its Linux
  libraries), so OXT-Beyond adds OpenSSL's `LICENSE.txt`, taken from the
  `openssl-3.6.4` tag of [openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
  and pinned by SHA-256 like the other files, as `OpenSSL-LICENSE.txt`
  to both extensions' `licenses/` folders. OpenSSL 3 has no `NOTICE`
  file. These copies are separate from the OpenSSL 3.5.9 inside
  `revsecurity.dll` ([Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries)).
- **MPL 2.0 source.** The source of libdatachannel and libjuice is at
  [paullouisageneau/libdatachannel](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel)
  and [paullouisageneau/libjuice](https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libjuice);
  dataChannelXT's `CMakeLists.txt` at the pinned commit gives the exact
  versions it builds.
- **The Microsoft Visual C++ runtime.** `enetxt.dll` and `box2dxt.dll`
  are built with the dynamic Visual C++ runtime; the other libraries
  link it statically or, like CoinXT's MinGW build, use Windows' own
  `msvcrt.dll`. So that they also load on a PC without the Visual C++
  Redistributable, the Windows packages include the DLLs they import
  next to them (the Linux package does not yet; see
  [The Linux x86-64 package](#the-linux-x86-64-package)), in the
  `code/x86_64-win32/` and `code/x86-win32/` folders of the two
  extensions: `msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll` and (x86-64 only)
  `vcruntime140_1.dll` for enetxt, `vcruntime140.dll` for Box2Dxt. They
  are copied unchanged from the Visual Studio redistributable folder
  (`VC\Redist\MSVC\<version>\<arch>\Microsoft.VC14x.CRT`) of the machine
  that made the package, and are pinned by SHA-256 in
  `tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json` (`vc_runtime`; now Visual Studio 2022
  17.14's, file version 14.44.35211.0), which packaging verifies.
  `XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt` gives each DLL's file version and SHA-256, and
  the redistributable folder they came from. They are Microsoft
  Distributable Code, not under the members' licences or the GPL: each
  of the two extensions has `licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`,
  which lists the DLLs, names Microsoft's terms and summarises what they
  require of anyone who distributes the DLLs further. See
  [Microsoft components](#microsoft-components).
- **Standalones.** When a standalone includes one of these extensions,
  the standalone builder copies its native libraries (for enetxt and
  Box2Dxt also the Visual C++ runtime DLLs) into the standalone, but not
  its `licenses/` folder. Include those licence files with your
  application. The copied runtime DLLs are Microsoft Distributable Code:
  redistributing them with a standalone is subject to Microsoft's terms
  (see `Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt` in the extension's `licenses/`
  folder). You may instead delete them from the standalone's `Externals`
  folder and require the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable on the
  PCs that run it.

### xTalk Suite demos

Three apps of the xTalk Suite are in
[`ide/Resources/Examples/xTalk Suite/`](ide/Resources/Examples/xTalk%20Suite/),
as stacks whose script is the suite's own file (see
[`tools/examples/README.md`](tools/examples/README.md#xtalk-suite-demos)):
No Cloud Quick Share (the suite's `nocloud`), Torrent Client
(`torrentxt/examples`) and Box2D Platformer (`box2dxt/examples`). They
are MIT, © 2026 Seth Morrow, under the suite's `LICENSE`, like the
extensions above. No Cloud Quick Share carries OnionXT's script inside
its own, and Box2D Platformer the Box2Dxt Kit's, both of them MIT, ©
2026 Seth Morrow. Box2D Platformer's pictures are Kenney's game assets
(kenney.nl), CC0 1.0 (public domain dedication), from the suite's
`box2dxt/Spritesheets`, imported into the stack; its sounds are made by
its script.

## Standalone runtimes for other platforms

Every package carries standalone runtimes for the other platforms that
the IDE's standalone builder targets, so that it can build standalones
for them and not only for its own platform. They come from one release
asset of this repository, `oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.zip` (release tag
`runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2`), listed with its SHA-256 in
[`tools/oxt/external-assets.json`](tools/oxt/external-assets.json). The
"Runtimes asset" workflow made it with
[`tools/oxt/make_runtimes_asset.py`](tools/oxt/make_runtimes_asset.py)
`--builds` from the outputs of this repository's CI builds of one
commit; only the Android runtime is not built here. Its `PROVENANCE.md`,
installed as `PROVENANCE-oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.md` at the root of the
program folder, names that commit and the CI runs and lists every file
with its size, SHA-256 and the build it comes from. Each package leaves
out what its own build makes: the Windows and Linux packages their own
x86-64 runtime and the time zone library's code for it, and the Linux
and macOS packages the zoneinfo data (the asset's `exclude`).

| Where it ends up | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Runtime/Windows/x86-32/`, and `Runtime/Windows/x86-64/` in the macOS and Linux packages | Windows standalone engines, `revsecurity.dll` and `revpdfprinter.dll`, the externals, the database drivers and CEF, built from this repository by the Windows workflow's 32-bit and 64-bit jobs: the same components as the Windows package's own files (see [Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries) and [Libraries built from `thirdparty/`](#libraries-built-from-thirdparty)). |
| `Runtime/Linux/x86-64/` in the Windows and macOS packages, and `Runtime/Linux/x86-32/` | Linux standalone engines, support libraries, externals and database drivers, built from this repository by the Linux workflow (x86-64 in its Ubuntu 20.04 container, x86 in its Debian 11 i386 container), with CEF in the x86-64 runtime only: the same components as the Linux package's own files (see [The Linux x86-64 package](#the-linux-x86-64-package)). There are no shared libraries of other projects in them: a Linux standalone uses the system's. |
| `Extensions/com.livecode.library.timezone/code/<platform>/` and `.../resources/` | The time zone library's native code for Windows x86-32 and x86-64 and Linux x86-32 and x86-64, built from this repository, and its zoneinfo data, compiled by the Linux x86-64 build; the Android code (next row) is 1.15's. |
| `Runtime/Android/` and `Extensions/com.livecode.library.timezone/code/*-android/` | Carried over unchanged from the earlier asset `oxt-runtimes-1.15`, which holds OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's files: Android standalone engines for four ABIs (version string 9.6.3-rc-3) and support files, of which 31 of 38 are identical to LiveCode's 9.6.3 installer and the others are as Tom Perry shipped them. That asset's provenance is installed as `PROVENANCE-oxt-runtimes-1.15.md`. |

Licences and corresponding source:

- **Built from this repository** (all but the Android files): as the
  packages' own files of those platforms: GPLv3 with the exception in
  [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md) for OXT-Beyond's code, and
  the third-party components of the sections above (OpenSSL, curl, ICU,
  the libraries of `thirdparty/`, CEF). Source: this repository at the
  commit that `PROVENANCE-oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.md` names.
- **Android files identical to LiveCode Community 9.6.3**: GPLv3.
  Source: [livecode/livecode](https://github.com/livecode/livecode), tag
  [`9.6.3`](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/9.6.3). This
  repository's history contains the upstream commits up to that tag.
- **The other Android files** (the engines that report `9.6.3-rc-3`,
  `Classes`, `Manifest.xml` and the arm64 `DbMysql`): GPLv3. They are as
  Tom Perry shipped them in OpenXTalk Lite; how each one was built is not
  recorded. They may be LiveCode builds (source: tag
  [`9.6.3-rc-3`](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/9.6.3-rc-3)
  or [`9.6.3`](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/9.6.3)) or
  builds by Tom (source: his archives at
  [openxtalk.net/OXT-lite-source](https://www.openxtalk.net/OXT-lite-source/index.php)).
- **IANA time zone data** (`resources/zoneinfo`): public domain; the
  source is in `extensions/libraries/timezone/tz/`.

The asset holds no standalone runtimes for macOS or iOS, and nothing
from `Ext/`. The macOS standalone runtimes are this repository's, in
the macOS package only (see [The macOS app](#the-macos-app)). Until
0.2.1-rc.2 the packages took the asset `oxt-runtimes-1.15` instead:
OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's runtimes, unchanged (LiveCode 9.6.3 builds for
32-bit Windows, and Linux runtimes with shared libraries of other
projects in their `lib/`), which had no Windows x86-64 runtime.

## The web runtime

Every package also carries the web runtime, from which the IDE makes
HTML5 standalones, in `Runtime/Emscripten/js/` (in the macOS app,
`Contents/Tools/Runtime/Emscripten/js/`). Every HTML5 standalone
contains its engine and its two fonts. It is built from this repository, in
the Ubuntu 22.04 container of `.github/workflows/web.yml`, with
Emscripten 6.0.12 (the version in `config/emscripten-version`); every
platform's package has the same files.

| Where it ends up | What it is | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standalone-community-<version>.wasm` and `.js` | The web engine, built from this repository, with revXML, revZip, revDB, revDB's SQLite driver and revSpeech linked into it, and these libraries built for the web: zlib, libpng, giflib, libjpeg, PCRE, Skia, libffi, libxml2, libxslt, libzip, SQLite and sqlitedataset (see [Libraries built from `thirdparty/`](#libraries-built-from-thirdparty)), OpenSSL 3.5.9 and ICU 78.3 (see [Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries)), and FreeType 2.10.4 and HarfBuzz 0.9.28 from `thirdparty/`, which draw its text | GPLv3 with the permission in [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md); the libraries as listed in those sections; FreeType: the FreeType License or GPLv2, at your choice ([`thirdparty/libfreetype/docs/`](thirdparty/libfreetype/docs/)); HarfBuzz: the MIT-style licence in its file headers (`thirdparty/libharfbuzz/src/`) |
| the same two files | Emscripten's runtime: the JavaScript that Emscripten writes around the engine, and the system libraries that it links into it (its C library, based on musl; libc++ and libc++abi; compiler-rt; dlmalloc) | Emscripten: MIT or the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, at your choice ([upstream](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/6.0.12/LICENSE)); musl: MIT; libc++, libc++abi and compiler-rt: Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions; dlmalloc: public domain |
| `standalone-community-<version>.html`, `emscripten-startup-template.livecodescript` | A standalone's page and the template of its startup script, from `engine/rsrc/` | GPLv3 |
| `emscripten-standalone-template/boot/standalone/DroidSansCombined.ttf` and `DroidSansCombined-Bold.ttf` | The two fonts that HTML5 standalones draw text with, plain and bold, made by [`tools/oxt/build_web_fonts.py`](tools/oxt/build_web_fonts.py) (from 0.2.7-rc.1; before, one file that came with LiveCode's HTML5 standalones, with no bold, whose licence field held Ascender Corporation's commercial licence): Droid Sans and Droid Sans Bold (builds 113 and 112, "Digitized data copyright © 2007, Google Corporation") and Droid Sans Fallback 2.55b from the Android Open Source Project, with about 400 symbols that the old file also drew (arrows, box drawing, circled numbers, maths) from DejaVu Sans 2.37 and Noto Sans CJK SC (2.004), each source taken from an Ubuntu 24.04 package and pinned by its SHA-256 in the script | The SIL Open Font License 1.1 ([text](https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/)), which Noto Sans CJK's glyphs bring to the files as a whole; the parts from Droid Sans and Droid Sans Fallback are also under the Apache License 2.0, which their files state ("Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0"), and DejaVu Sans' under the Bitstream Vera Fonts licence (DejaVu's changes are in the public domain). The licence field of each file says so. "Droid" is a trademark of Google. |

## The macOS app

`OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` and `-mac-universal.zip` hold
`OXT-Beyond.app`: the engine in `Contents/MacOS`, and in
`Contents/Tools` everything that the Windows program folder holds at its
root (the IDE, externals, toolchain, extensions and runtimes).
`-mac-universal-binaries.tar.xz` holds the build output (`Release/`,
like the Windows binaries zip) without the build's own tools
(`gentle-target`, `reflex-target`, `perfect-target`, the lc-compile
bootstrap stages, `zic`, `lcidlc`; see [GENTLE](#gentle)), and
`-mac-universal-symbols.zip` its `.dSYM` debug symbols (not those of the
build's own tools). Every program file below is built from this
repository twice, for Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x86_64), and the
two are joined into one file with `lipo`. This list was made from the
files the macOS packaging stages. What is not mentioned is as on
Windows: the IDE, the xTalk Suite extensions (whose macOS libraries
are the `code/universal-mac/*.dylib` files; see
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions)) and the runtimes
asset.

They statically link the libraries listed under [Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries) (OpenSSL 3.5.9 and ICU 78.3, built from source by the macOS workflow; there is no CEF on macOS, where revBrowser and the browser widget use the system's WebKit) and under [Libraries built from `thirdparty/`](#libraries-built-from-thirdparty), plus iODBC (next row). The GENTLE-generated parser is in `lc-compile` and `lc-compile-ffi-java`, as on Windows (see [GENTLE](#gentle)). |

| `Contents/Tools/Runtime/Mac OS X/x86-64/Standalone.app`, `x64-ARM64/Standalone-blank.app` and `x86-32/Standalone.app` (with `Support/` and `Externals/`, and `arm64/Externals/`) | the macOS standalone engine (`Standalone-Community.app` of the same build), under the folder names the IDE's standalone builder uses; it becomes part of every Mac standalone | GPLv3, with the same statically linked libraries as the engine |
| `Contents/Tools/Extensions/com.livecode.library.timezone/code/universal-mac-macosx/tz.dylib` and `.../resources/zoneinfo` | the time zone library's native code and the IANA time zone data, built here (the runtimes asset's copies are left out) | see [Third-party code inside LiveCode's own sources](#third-party-code-inside-livecodes-own-sources) (IANA tz: public domain, some files BSD 3-clause) |
| `Contents/Resources/OXT-Beyond.icns` | the OXT-Beyond icon, made from the images in `Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/png/` by [`tools/oxt/icns.py`](tools/oxt/icns.py) | see [The OXT-Beyond icon](#the-oxt-beyond-icon) |
| `Contents/Resources/LiveCode.icns`, `LiveCodeDoc.icns` (the icon of LiveCode's own document types), `terminology.sdef`, `LiveCode-Community.rsrc`, the `*.lproj/Localisation.strings`; `Standalone.icns` and `StandaloneDoc.icns` in each runtime (the default icons of Mac standalones) | LiveCode Community's resources from `engine/rsrc/` | GPLv3, as part of LiveCode Community.

The macOS system frameworks and libraries that this code uses (AppKit,
WebKit, libc++, libcups and the rest) are part of macOS and are not
shipped. The app, every bundle and every Mach-O file of macOS code in it
are signed ad hoc (no Apple Developer ID); the signatures are made in CI
and contain no third-party material.

Not in the macOS packages: the Visual C++ runtime DLLs of enetxt and
Box2Dxt (the macOS workflow has no Visual Studio to take them from), so
the Windows libraries of those two extensions, which the macOS app
carries for building Windows standalones, need the Microsoft Visual C++
Redistributable on the PC that runs such a standalone; and the Windows
x86-64 standalone runtime, which only the Windows build makes.

**OpenSSL on macOS.** `revsecurity.dylib` (which the engine, the
standalones and the database drivers use for SSL and encryption) and the
server engine statically link OpenSSL 3.5.9 on macOS, as they do on
Windows and Linux. OpenSSL 3 is under the Apache License 2.0, which the
Free Software Foundation considers compatible with the GPLv3, so this
combination needs no additional permission. (LiveCode Ltd's permission
in [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md) describes the feature
"on Windows and Linux"; whether it covered the macOS packages of
0.2.1-rc.2 and earlier, which linked OpenSSL 1.1.1w, has not been
reviewed: see [Still to review](#still-to-review).)

## The Linux x86-64 package

`OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` holds the same IDE and
licence files as the Windows packages, their xTalk Suite extensions
except for the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime (see below), the Linux
engine, externals and tools built from this repository (in the Ubuntu
20.04 container of `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`), and the parts
of the runtimes asset that the Linux build does not replace. What
differs from the Windows packages, file by file (every CEF file is
there twice, in `Externals/CEF/` for the IDE and in
`Runtime/Linux/x86-64/Externals/CEF/` for standalones; the tarball
stores the second copy as a hard link):

| Where it ends up | What it is | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OXT-Beyond`, `revpdfprinter.so`, `revsecurity.so`, `Externals/*.so`, `Externals/Database Drivers/*.so`, `Toolchain/lc-compile`, `lc-run`, `lc-compile-ffi-java`, and in `Runtime/Linux/x86-64/` the standalone engine `Standalone` with its own `Support/` and `Externals/` | Built from this repository, with the libraries of [Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries) and [Libraries built from `thirdparty/`](#libraries-built-from-thirdparty) as on Windows, except that the engines and revPDFPrinter use the system's FreeType and Fontconfig instead of linking their own, and `dbodbc.so` links iODBC (next row) | GPLv3 with the permission in [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md); the third-party parts as listed in those sections |
| `Externals/Database Drivers/dbodbc.so` | iODBC 3.52.5 (`thirdparty/libiodbc`), the ODBC driver manager, statically linked (on Windows the driver uses the system's `odbc32.dll`) | GNU Library General Public License version 2 or the BSD licence, at your choice: [`thirdparty/libiodbc/docs/`](thirdparty/libiodbc/docs/) (`LICENSE`, `LICENSE.LGPL`, `LICENSE.BSD`) |
| `Externals/CEF/libcef.so`, `cef.pak`, `cef_100_percent.pak`, `cef_200_percent.pak`, `cef_extensions.pak`, `natives_blob.bin`, `snapshot_blob.bin`, `v8_context_snapshot.bin`, `locales/*.pak` (52 locales) | Chromium Embedded Framework 74.1.19+gb62bacf with Chromium 74.0.3729.157 (including V8): the `linux64_minimal` binary distribution from Spotify's CEF build server (`cef-builds.spotifycdn.com`), taken by `prebuilt/scripts/build-cef.sh`. Left out of the package: `chrome-sandbox` (CEF runs without its sandbox) and `devtools_resources.pak` | CEF: BSD 3-clause; Chromium: BSD 3-clause for its own code, and many components under their own licences (see [Prebuilt libraries](#prebuilt-libraries) and [Still to review](#still-to-review)) |
| `Externals/CEF/icudtl.dat` | ICU data, as bundled with Chromium 74 | Unicode licence (ICU) |
| `Externals/CEF/libEGL.so`, `libGLESv2.so` | ANGLE, as bundled with Chromium 74 | BSD 3-clause |
| `Externals/CEF/swiftshader/libEGL.so`, `libGLESv2.so` | SwiftShader, as bundled with Chromium 74 | Apache License 2.0 |
| `Externals/CEF/revbrowser-cefprocess`, `libbrowser-cefprocess` (at the root, and both at the root of `Runtime/Linux/x86-64/`) | The CEF helper processes of revBrowser and the browser widget, built from this repository (`revbrowser/`, `libbrowser/`) | GPLv3 |
| `Extensions/com.livecode.library.timezone/code/x86_64-linux/tz.so` and `resources/zoneinfo/` | The time zone library and the IANA zoneinfo data, built from this repository (the Windows packages take both from the runtimes asset) | GPLv3; the zoneinfo data is public domain |
| `oxt-beyond`, `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `linux/` | The launcher, the per-user install scripts, the desktop entry, the MIME type definitions and the library list (from `Installer/linux/`), and the OXT-Beyond icon in eight sizes (see [The OXT-Beyond icon](#the-oxt-beyond-icon)) | GPLv3 |

The Linux package's own `Runtime/Linux/x86-64` is its build's; the
runtimes asset adds the other platforms' runtimes, as in the other
packages: `Runtime/Windows/x86-64/`, `Runtime/Windows/x86-32/`,
`Runtime/Linux/x86-32/`, `Runtime/Android/` and the time zone library's
code for those platforms (see
[Standalone runtimes for other platforms](#standalone-runtimes-for-other-platforms)).

The Linux package does not contain the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime
DLLs (`msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, `vcruntime140_1.dll`) that the
Windows packages put next to the Windows libraries of enetxt and
Box2Dxt, nor those two extensions'
`licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`: only the Windows packaging
job has a Visual Studio redistributable folder to take them from, until
the other packages get them from the Windows build. The Windows
libraries themselves (`code/x86_64-win32/`, `code/x86-win32/`) are there,
and the package's `Extensions/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt` says that the
runtime is not bundled. So a Windows standalone built on Linux that
includes enetxt or Box2Dxt (a 32-bit one, as long as the package has
only the Windows x86-32 runtime) needs the Visual C++ Redistributable on
the PC it runs on.

The package does not contain the system libraries that the engine and
CEF load: GTK 2, GDK, GLib, Pango, cairo, FreeType, Fontconfig, X11 and
its extensions, NSS, NSPR, ALSA, D-Bus, expat and the accessibility
libraries (`linux/libraries.txt`, which the launcher checks). They come
from the user's distribution, under their own licences. Where the table
in [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) says so, the
extensions' Linux libraries use the system's OpenSSL 3.

## Files OpenXTalk Lite shipped that OXT-Beyond does not

OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 shipped these files. OXT-Beyond leaves them out of
the repository, its history and its packages:

| File | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `Ext/` (the mergExt externals blur 1.1.53, mergJSON 1.0.70, mergMarkdown 1.0.66 and mergMicrophone 1.0.66, for Windows, Linux and macOS) | The collection that LiveCode's installer builder downloaded from LiveCode's server. Each folder has a `LICENSE.txt` (MIT texts naming Trevor DeVore or M E R Goulding, and the GPLv3 text), but whether these cover the binaries as shipped, and where their corresponding source is, has not been established. Until it has, OXT-Beyond does not redistribute them. Stacks that use them need a copy from elsewhere. |
| `Documentation/linked_files/apple-human-interface-guidelines-2005.pdf` | Apple Inc. copyright, with no licence to redistribute. |
| `Documentation/linked_files/animationEngine6.zip` | A third-party library with no licence in the release. |

[`tools/oxt/layout.py`](tools/oxt/layout.py) classes the last two as
"excluded" (`NOT_REDISTRIBUTABLE`), and
[`tools/oxt/package.py`](tools/oxt/package.py) reports `Ext/` as an
intended difference from OpenXTalk Lite 1.15. OpenXTalk Lite's
`OpenXTalk Lite.lnk` shortcut and two empty SQLite files (`test.db`,
`Toolset/palettes/dictionary/api.sqlite`) are left out as well; they
contain nothing of use.

## The installer

`OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-setup.exe` is made with
[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 6. The setup program and
the uninstaller it installs contain Inno Setup's code, Copyright ©
Jordan Russell and portions Copyright © Martijn Laan, under the
[Inno Setup License](https://jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt), a
permissive licence. The installer script
([`Installer/oxt-beyond/oxt-beyond.iss`](Installer/oxt-beyond/oxt-beyond.iss))
is part of OXT-Beyond.

## Microsoft components

The engine and revBrowser use Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL),
and the binaries built from this repository statically link the
Microsoft Visual C++ runtime. Two of the bundled xTalk Suite extensions,
enetxt and Box2Dxt, need the runtime as DLLs instead, so the Windows
packages also contain Microsoft's redistributable `msvcp140.dll`,
`vcruntime140.dll` and `vcruntime140_1.dll` as separate files, in those
extensions' `code/x86_64-win32/` and `code/x86-win32/` folders,
unchanged from Visual Studio's redistributable folder and pinned by
SHA-256 in `tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json`, which packaging verifies
(see [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions)). They are
Microsoft Distributable Code, not open source and not covered by
OXT-Beyond's GPLv3: they are distributed under the Distributable Code
section of the
[Microsoft Software License Terms for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/license-terms/)
and its [REDIST list](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2022/redistribution).
Those terms' distribution requirements (among them: only unmodified,
only as part of a program that adds significant functionality, under
terms that protect them at least as much as Microsoft's) pass to anyone
who redistributes the DLLs, for example in a standalone.
`Extensions/org.openxtalk.library.enet/licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`
and `Extensions/org.openxtalk.box2dxt/licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`
list the DLLs and say this next to them. (The Linux package has neither
the DLLs nor these two files; see
[The Linux x86-64 package](#the-linux-x86-64-package).) The ATL
combination is the reason for the licence exception in
[LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md).

## GENTLE

GENTLE 97 Campus Edition (Metarga GmbH) is in `toolchain/gentle/`. It
has been in the LiveCode Community tree since upstream. Its licence,
[`toolchain/gentle/LICENSE`](toolchain/gentle/LICENSE), has two parts:

- **GENTLE itself** is a build-time tool and is not shipped. It may be
  used at no charge for personal and educational purposes and in
  non-commercial projects; commercial use of any kind needs a licence
  from Metarga, and GENTLE itself may not be redistributed (apart from
  the copies the licence allows to be given to students and project
  partners). The Linux and macOS builds leave it in their build output
  as `gentle-target` and `reflex-target`; `tools/oxt/package_dist.py`
  keeps those, and the build's other own tools, out of the binaries and
  symbols archives, and fails if a `gentle-*` or `reflex-*` file would
  get in.
- **What GENTLE generates is shipped.** The build uses GENTLE to
  generate the parser of the LiveCode Builder compiler, and that
  parser, together with the GENTLE runtime (`grts`), is compiled into
  `lc-compile.exe` and `lc-compile-ffi-java.exe` on Windows, and into
  `lc-compile` and `lc-compile-ffi-java` on macOS and Linux. They are in
  the build outputs (`win-x86_64-bin`, the macOS `Release/`,
  `linux-x86_64-bin`), and so in the binaries zip and the macOS and
  Linux binaries tar.xz archives, and in `Toolchain/` of the installed
  program (in the app, `Contents/Tools/Toolchain/`). For a
  non-commercial project, the licence allows the generated code and the
  runtime to be distributed as part of software distributed under the
  GNU General Public License, and it puts software generated with
  GENTLE under the GNU General Public License version 2 text that
  follows in the same file.

## Build-time tools (not shipped)

| Component | Where | Licence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GENTLE 97 Campus Edition | `toolchain/gentle/` | see [GENTLE](#gentle) | Generates the LiveCode Builder compiler's parser; its output is shipped, as described above. |
| gyp | `gyp/` | BSD 3-clause | Generates the Visual Studio projects. [`gyp/LICENSE`](gyp/LICENSE) |
| Google Test | `libcpptest/googletest` (submodule) | BSD 3-clause | C++ unit tests only. |
| Cygwin, Python, Perl, Visual Studio, Inno Setup, Chocolatey | installed separately | their own licences | See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). Inno Setup's code is part of the setup program (see [The installer](#the-installer)). |
| The Emscripten SDK (Emscripten, LLVM, Binaryen, Node.js) | installed separately | their own licences | Builds the web engine (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#14-building-the-web-engine)); what it puts into the engine is listed in [The web runtime](#the-web-runtime). |

## Still to review

- **LiveCode Ltd's OpenSSL permission on macOS, for 0.2.1-rc.2 and
  earlier.** The permission in [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md)
  names Windows and Linux; the macOS packages up to 0.2.1-rc.2 combined
  the same GPL code with OpenSSL 1.1.1w. Whether the permission covered
  them needs a legal read by the maintainer. Later packages use OpenSSL 3
  (see [The macOS app](#the-macos-app)), for which the question does not
  arise.
- **Tom Perry's condition** on `community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite`
  (quoted [above](#tom-perrys-notice-for-communityopenxtalkpluginoxtlite))
  is a restriction that the GPLv3 does not contain. How it fits with
  distributing the plugin inside a GPLv3 program has not been reviewed.
- **FerrusLogic's DevGuides** has a copyright line but no licence text.
  Its terms should be confirmed with FerrusLogic.
- **`community.openxtalk.plugin.oxtlite` was started from DevGuides'
  template.** Its script-local and constant declarations (lines 13-14 of
  `OXTLiteFunctions.livecodescript`) are identical to lines 12-13 of
  `DevGuides.livecodescript`, and its `extensionInitialize` /
  `extensionFinalize` skeleton follows the same pattern, so Tom Perry's
  "No copyright" notice sits over a few lines that come from FerrusLogic.
  This depends on the FerrusLogic question above.
- **The Calendar and Pie Chart widgets** have no copyright or licence
  header, and their origin is not recorded.
- **Paul McClernan's macOS Native Tools** states "MIT" but does not
  include the MIT licence text and copyright notice that the MIT licence
  asks for.
- **Droid Sans Mono** is under the Apache License 2.0, but the licence
  text is not shipped next to the font.
- **`neville-segments.mp4`**, the examples whose authors are not
  recorded (and their remasters), and **`Documentation/linked_files/`**
  (the sample stacks and zip archives from LiveCode's lessons and
  samples): authors and terms are not recorded.
- **Terry Little's Text To Image** (`ide/Resources/Examples/`) says
  "Terry Little ©2013, All Rights Reserved" and grants no licence,
  unlike his Animate Letter, DataGrid Table and Quick Start, which state
  the GPL version 3 or later. It ships as OpenXTalk Lite shipped it, and
  it has no remaster (`tools/examples`) until he agrees to one.
- **The runtimes asset's Android files:** how Tom Perry built those
  that differ from LiveCode's 9.6.3 files is not recorded. Building the
  Android runtime from source would settle it (the other runtimes are
  built from source from 0.2.1-rc.3 on).
- `extensions/libraries/iconsvg/` contains SVG path data for Font Awesome
  icons (its default "fontawesome" icon family). The Font Awesome version
  and the licence notice that should go with it are not recorded in the
  repository.
- `ide/Documentation/html_viewer/js/highlight.pack.js` (highlight.js) and
  `jquery.session.js` have no licence header, and their versions are not
  recorded.
- `ide/Toolset/resources/supporting_files/fonts/fontawesome.ttf` is an
  IcoMoon-generated icon font named "fontawesome" (presumably Font
  Awesome icons), and `lcideicons.ttf` a
  Fontello-generated icon font ("Copyright (C) 2014 by original authors
  @ fontello.com"). Which icons they contain, and the licence notices
  that should go with them, are not recorded in the repository. The
  folder's `LICENSE.txt` covers only Source Code Pro.
- How GENTLE's terms for generated software (the GPL version 2 text and
  the non-commercial condition) fit with distributing `lc-compile.exe`
  under the GPLv3 has not been reviewed. Nor has the fact that this
  repository, like LiveCode Community before it, contains GENTLE's own
  source in `toolchain/gentle/`.
- Chromium 74 bundles many components with their own notices. This file
  does not reproduce them.
- **The xTalk Suite extensions.** The Visual C++ runtime DLLs shipped
  with enetxt and Box2Dxt are there because those two members build with
  the dynamic runtime (`/MD`). A notice next to them
  (`licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`) now passes Microsoft's
  terms for Distributable Code on to whoever redistributes them; whether
  this fully satisfies those terms (which ask distributors to bind their
  end users to protective terms, while the installer shows only the
  GPLv3), and how they fit with distributing the DLLs inside a GPLv3
  program, has not been reviewed. The preferred resolution is a `/MT`
  build upstream, as SodiumXT, TorrentXT and DataChannelXT already use,
  which would remove the DLLs and the notice. The OpenSSL licence text
  that OXT-Beyond adds for TorrentXT and DataChannelXT, and the
  statement in DataChannelXT's licence files that OpenSSL is not bundled,
  should be fixed in the member repositories. The Box2Dxt module reports
  version 0.2.0 while its CHANGELOG already has a 0.3.0 section. The
  bundled Visual C++ runtime (14.44, from Visual Studio 2022) is older
  than the toolset (14.51) that built `enetxt.dll` and `box2dxt.dll`,
  which Microsoft does not support; a `/MT` build upstream, or a
  redistributable folder of 14.51 or newer, would remove the mismatch.
  The macOS `torrentxt.dylib` compiles libtorrent's
  `include/libtorrent/aux_/route.h`: libtorrent's `enum_net.cpp` uses it
  instead of `<net/route.h>` whenever `TARGET_OS_IPHONE` is defined, and
  the macOS SDK always defines it. The header is under the Apple Public
  Source License 2.0, which the FSF lists as incompatible with the GPL.
  It holds only structure and macro definitions. How this fits with
  distributing the library inside a GPLv3 program has not been
  reviewed.
