# Writes the scripts inside the binary IDE stacks (ide/ and ide-support/)
# to stack-scripts/, one file per object script, so that Git can show what
# changed in them (tools/oxt/stack_scripts.py says how they are named), or
# with --check reports whether stack-scripts/ matches the stacks.
#
#   tools/oxt/stack-scripts.sh <development engine> [--check]
#
# <development engine> is the LiveCode-Community program of a Linux or macOS
# build (for example from a release's linux-x86_64-binaries archive). Each
# stack is read with tools/oxt/ide-stack-dump.livecodescript, headless, with
# messages locked, and never saved, so the stacks are not changed. Run it
# after changing a binary stack and commit stack-scripts/ with the stack;
# the Linux build checks it (build-linux.yml, "Binary stack scripts").
