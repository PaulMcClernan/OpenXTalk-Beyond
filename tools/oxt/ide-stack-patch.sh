# Applies the script patches of tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches to the binary
# IDE stacks in the repository's ide folder, with a development engine and
# no user interface (tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.livecodescript explains the
# patches and how the result is verified).
#
#   tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.sh <development engine> [--check]
#
# <development engine> is the LiveCode-Community program of a Linux or macOS
# build of this repository (for example from the linux-x86_64-bin artifact
# of a CI run). --check only reports whether each patch is applied.
#
# Run it again after changing a patch: patches that are applied already are
# left alone. Without --check it then brings stack-scripts/ up to date with
# the stacks (tools/oxt/stack-scripts.sh); commit that with the patch. Do not use a Windows engine on a PC where OXT-Beyond or
# LiveCode is running: a second Windows engine hands its command line to
# the running one (engine/src/w32relaunch.cpp) instead of running it.
