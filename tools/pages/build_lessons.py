"""Make the lessons of the GitHub Pages site (lessons/): a course in xTalk
from the first line to extensions in xTalk Builder, a page a lesson, with
a page that lists them all and a search of every word on every page.

  python3 tools/pages/build_lessons.py --out DIR [--with-ide] [--with-dictionary]

  DIR/index.html          the lessons' own front page (lessons/index.html):
                          the levels, a card for each lesson, the search
  DIR/<slug>/index.html   a lesson (lessons/src/NN-<slug>.html in
                          lessons/lesson.html)
  DIR/lessons.css         the pages' look, and lessons.js what they do
  DIR/search-index.js     every section of every lesson, as text, for the
                          search, which a page loads when its search box
                          is first used
  DIR/shots/<id>.png      the pictures of the stage (lessons/shots)

A lesson is a fragment of HTML in lessons/src, named NN-<slug>.html (NN
puts them in order), that begins with a comment of its own with a line for
each of title, level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert or
extensions, in that order through the files), minutes, summary and words
(the xTalk words it teaches, comma-separated):

  <!--
  title: Variables
  level: beginner
  minutes: 8
  summary: Give values names, and change them.
  words: put, into, add
  -->

Each <h2> has an id, which the page's contents and the search link to.
An example is a <figure class="example"> with its code in
<pre class="code"><code> and what it puts in <pre class="out">, as text
(examples() below says what one needs); this script colours the code and
adds the bar with its Copy button, so the source stays the code as it
runs. tools/ci/lessons_check.py runs every example with the xTalk
Academy's runner on an engine and compares what it puts with the page.

An example that makes something to see (a button, a field, a drawing)
can show the stage under it, the window the playground shows what the
code made in: data-shot on its figure says what the picture shows, for a
reader who cannot see it, and the picture is lessons/shots/<its id>.png,
which the engine took when it ran the example (lessons_check.py
--update-shots) and the check compares with what the engine draws each
time. The build refuses an example with no picture, and a picture with
no example.

A card the reader builds. A beginner draws controls with the Tools
palette and names them in the Property Inspector, so a lesson about
controls says how to build the card, in a <div class="build" id="build-...">
of steps, and its examples work on that card (data-card="build-..."):
lines for the Message Box (data-in="message"), or the script of one of
its controls (data-script='button "Go"', or a card's) that the reader clicks in Run
mode (data-click, the controls clicked in order, separated by ";"); and
data-after names the examples before it whose scripts the reader has
put in already (ids, separated by ";"). The
build box also has, in <pre class="setup">, the xTalk that makes the same
card, as the palette makes it: the check runs it before the example (and
installs the script and clicks), and the page leaves it out. Such an
example's Output is what the Message Box shows: what each line put, or,
for a script, what it shows after each click (a put replaces the one
before, so a click that puts twice shows the second).

build_pages.py makes the lessons with every site; the Web IDE and the
Dictionary are linked only when the site has them (the IDE and DICTIONARY
blocks of the templates, as on the front page).
