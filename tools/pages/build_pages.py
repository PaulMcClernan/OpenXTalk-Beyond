"""Make the GitHub Pages site (.github/workflows/pages.yml) from a release's
web zips: the web IDE and the Stack Player, each in a folder of its own,
with a front page that links to both, and to the codebase map when one is
given.

  python3 tools/pages/build_pages.py --out DIR
      [--ide ZIP --ide-version V] [--player ZIP --player-version V]
      [--map HTML --map-version V]
      [--release TAG --release-assets FILE]
      [--suite-release TAG --suite-assets FILE]

  DIR/index.html     the front page (tools/pages/index.html)
  DIR/brand/         the logo it shows (tools/pages/brand)
  DIR/ide/           OXT-Beyond-<version>-web-ide.zip's site (tools/web-ide)
  DIR/player/        OXT-Beyond-<version>-web-player.zip's site
                     (tools/web-player)
  DIR/play/          the bare player: the zip's play/index.html (the
                     stack and nothing else, tools/web-player/play.html),
                     a site of its own beside the player, on the player's
                     engine and stack (left out for a zip without it)
  DIR/dictionary/    the Dictionary that the IDE's Help > Dictionary Online
                     opens, made from the web IDE's own html_viewer and
                     dictionary data (tools/pages/build_dictionary.py), so
                     it is the IDE's of the same release; left out, with a
                     note, when the web IDE has none (one before 0.2.7)
  DIR/lessons/       the lessons, from the first line of xTalk to
                     extensions in xTalk Builder: a page a lesson, with a
                     search (tools/pages/build_lessons.py, from
                     tools/pages/lessons); they link the web IDE and the
                     Dictionary when the site has them
  DIR/extensions/    the xTalk Suite's extensions, built into OXT-Beyond,
                     each with its .lce package for the other IDEs built
                     on LiveCode Community 9: the files of the suite
                     release --suite-release (FILE lists its file names),
                     or a link to the suite's releases without one
                     (tools/pages/extensions/index.html)
  DIR/map/           the codebase map: the one self-contained page that
                     tools/codebase-map/build_map.py writes (index.html),
                     and beside it, when build_map.py wrote them next to
                     the page, the binary stacks' scripts as files
                     (stack-scripts/ and stack-scripts.zip)

With --release, the front page has a Downloads section: the desktop
packages, the web zips and the plugins of that release, each linked
straight to its file on GitHub, as the forum posts link them. FILE lists
the release's file names, one a line (gh release view TAG --json assets
--jq '.assets[].name'), and a file the release does not have gets no
link, so no link on the page leads to a missing file; a platform with
none of its files is left out, and the section too when it has none.

Each zip holds its site in one folder (StackPlayer/, or the web IDE's
folder named after its zip); the folder with index.html is the one taken.
The web IDE zip's local server and its notes (serve.py, Start Web IDE.bat,
README.txt) are for running it on a computer, so they are left out. The
sites are copied as they are: both ask for their engine with relative
addresses and their own ?v= stamp, so they run from any folder, and the
web engine uses no threads, so GitHub Pages needs no special headers.

A part that is not given is left out, and the front page leaves out its
card. GitHub Pages refuses a file over 100 MB, so a bigger one stops the
build here, where the message says which file it is.
