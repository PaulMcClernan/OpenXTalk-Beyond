"""The Android runtime's Java layer, Runtime/Android/Classes: build it from
this repository's sources, compare it with another build of it class by
class and method by method, and check that it agrees with the Android engine
across JNI (the Android plan's phase 1).

  python3 tools/ci/android_java.py build --sdk DIR --out FILE [--api N] [--jdk DIR]
  python3 tools/ci/android_java.py compare --old FILE --new FILE
  python3 tools/ci/android_java.py jni --classes FILE --runtime DIR [--android-jar FILE]

build compiles the Java sources that LiveCode's own build compiled into
Classes (engine_java_source_files and engine_aidl_source_files of
engine/engine-sources.gypi, as engine/kernel.gyp and config/java.gypi did),
with the JDK's javac for Java 8 against the SDK's android.jar of --api, into
a jar whose bytes depend only on the class files (names sorted, one fixed
time). Each AIDL interface is compiled from the Java kept beside its .aidl
file, which is what LiveCode's build had aidl make of it (compare checks
that against the shipped classes), so that javac is the only tool it
needs.

compare reads two such jars (the released runtime's and a new build) and
fails on any difference that EXPECTED does not name for the old jar's
SHA-256: a class or member that is gone or changed, and a method whose code
differs. Code is compared as the instructions mean it, not as the bytes
lie, so that two compilers' ways of writing the same method compare equal
(code_listing says which differences it sees through). Classes and members
that only the new jar has are listed, and fail only when the old jar has no
entry in EXPECTED. An entry of EXPECTED that no longer differs fails too,
so that the list cannot keep a reason that is no longer true.

jni checks the two ways the native engine and the Java layer meet:

  - every Java_* function that an engine of the runtime (each architecture's
    Standalone) exports is a native method of a class in the jar, and
    every native method of the jar has its Java_* function in every
    engine, apart from UNEXPORTED (natives the engine never had);
  - every Java method that the engine's C++ sources look up by name and
    signature (MCAndroid*Call, GetMethodID, GetStaticMethodID; the
    sources in NATIVE_SOURCES) is there with that signature, in the class
    the call names or, for calls on an object, in a class of the jar or one
    of its Android superclasses (--android-jar, the SDK's android.jar);
    the calls whose method name the arm64 engine does not hold are
    counted apart, as calls of the source that the runtime's engine does
    not make;
  - every binding of an LCB extension to a class of the jar
    ("java:com.runrev...", extensions/**/*.lcb) is there, as the binding
    says (an interface, a static method, a method);
  - every class of the jar that the runtime's Manifest.xml or the
    standalone builder names (com.runrev.android.X) is there.

Exit status 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise. Only the Python 3
standard library is used (3.8 or later), with the JDK's javac for build.
