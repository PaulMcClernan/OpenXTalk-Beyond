# Builds the web (HTML5) engine of this checkout and writes the web runtime
# into a new folder:
#
#   tools/ci/build-web.sh <runtime folder>
#   tools/ci/build-web.sh --libraries
#
# (--libraries builds only the libraries below, which a cache can then
# keep whether the engine builds or not.)
#
# The web runtime is what an installed OXT-Beyond has in
# Runtime/Emscripten/js (tools/oxt/package.py --web-runtime installs it),
# where the IDE's web builder takes a web standalone's files from:
#
#   standalone-community-<version>.js, .wasm   the engine (WebAssembly that
#                                              waits with Asyncify)
#   standalone-community-<version>.html        the page
#   emscripten-standalone-template/            the files every standalone
#                                              gets (its font)
#   emscripten-startup-template.livecodescript the startup script's template
#
# <version> is BUILD_SHORT_VERSION in the file version, which the IDE's
# builder asks for (the version of the IDE).
#
# It needs Linux with the tools of a Linux build (BUILDING.md: gcc and g++,
# make, perl, bison and flex, and Python 2.7 as "python" for gyp and
# config.py), python3 3.10 or later, and the Emscripten SDK of the version
# in config/emscripten-version, activated (emcc on PATH, which
# <emsdk>/emsdk_env.sh does) or named by EMSDK. .github/workflows/web.yml
# runs it in an Ubuntu 22.04 container, which has both Pythons.
#
# The libraries: the engine links ICU and the Thirdparty libraries built
# with Emscripten (prebuilt/lib/emscripten/js), and the build's host tools
# (lc-compile, and the others that make the engine's sources) link ICU,
# libz and libffi built for Linux (prebuilt/lib/linux/<arch>). No server
# publishes these, so this script builds the ones that are missing:
# ICU and the Thirdparty libraries with prebuilt/build-libraries.sh (ICU's
# source is the only download), libz and libffi in a Linux build folder,
# build-linux-<arch>, which is configured for nothing else. Then it marks
# prebuilt's library folders as fetched, so that the build does not run
# prebuilt/fetch-libraries.sh, which would look for tarballs that nobody
# publishes. A second run, or a run with those folders restored from a
# cache (web.yml), builds only the engine.
#
# Environment:
#   WEB_JOBS  how many jobs make runs at once (default: the number of
#             processors)
#   EMSDK     the Emscripten SDK, when emcc is not on PATH
