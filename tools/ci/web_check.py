"""Build a web standalone of a probe stack and run it in a headless
browser.

  python3 tools/ci/web_check.py --runtime DIR (--engine FILE | --engine-cache DIR)
      [--browser B] [--work DIR] [--timeout SECONDS] [--keep-serving]
  python3 tools/ci/web_check.py (--install DIR | --package FILE | --bin DIR)
      [--platform P] [--ide-timeout SECONDS] [--work DIR] [--timeout SECONDS]
  python3 tools/ci/web_check.py --built DIR [--work DIR] [--timeout SECONDS]

The probe stack is tools/ci/web-probe.livecodescript, with a button, a
field, a graphic and a PNG image (tools/ci/web-deploy.livecodescript makes
it). There are three ways to its standalone:

--runtime, without the IDE. DIR is the web runtime: the folder that the
IDE's web builder takes its files from (Runtime/Emscripten/js in an
installed OXT-Beyond, and the web build's output in CI), which holds

  standalone-community-<version>.js and .wasm   the engine
  standalone-community-<version>.html           the page template
  emscripten-standalone-template/               the files every standalone
                                                gets (its fonts)
  emscripten-startup-template.livecodescript    the startup script template

A development engine (--engine; or --engine-cache, which downloads the
Linux x86_64 engine of the OXT-Beyond release that tools/ci/build_docs.sh
pins into that folder, checked against its SHA-256) runs
web-deploy.livecodescript with -ui: it saves the probe stack and writes its
startup data with "_internal deploy emscripten", as the IDE's builder
(ide-support/revsaveasemscriptenstandalone.livecodescript) does, with the
modules of the browser widget and the library it uses from the engine's
packaged_extensions. Any engine can deploy for the web: the deploy command
only writes the stack, the modules and the startup script. This script
then makes the rest as the builder does: standalone.zip gets the template
folder (without dotfiles) and boot/__startup.data, and the folder gets the
engine's .js and .wasm and the page, WebProbe.html, with the stack's title
in its <title>.

--install, --package or --bin, with the IDE's own web builder. The IDE
starts as a user starts it, with web-deploy.livecodescript named on its
command line (as tools/ci/ui_tour.py starts it; under xvfb-run on Linux
without a DISPLAY). Once the IDE has started, the script builds the probe
stack with revSaveAsEmscriptenStandalone and the standalone settings that
a new stack has, and writes its lines to <work>/ide-build.txt. --install
is an installed layout and --package a package to extract, which must hold
the web runtime (Runtime/Emscripten/js in the tools folder); --bin is the
build output of a repository checkout, whose IDE is the checkout's
(repository mode) and whose web runtime is <checkout>/emscripten-bin.

--built, a standalone of the probe stack that is already built: DIR holds
its page, standalone.zip and the engine.

Then:

1. A web server on 127.0.0.1 serves the standalone's folder, and the
   requests the probe makes: GET /probe-data.txt, POST /echo (which
   answers "POST <Content-Type> <body>"), PUT and GET /store, a 404, and
   GET /probe-page.html, the page that its browser widget loads.

2. Headless Chromium (Playwright) opens the page. The probe writes PROBE
   lines to the console (see web-probe.livecodescript): its checks of
   waits (in openStack, in handlers, nested, with messages, until a
   condition), "send ... in", "do ... as JavaScript", files, a font file
   that it starts and stops using, URLs (get, post, put, load with
   message, a missing page), the page's dialogs (answer, answer with two
   buttons, ask), whose default buttons this script clicks, typing "Ada"
   into the ask dialog's field, the standard folders, a file written to
   /downloads (which must reach the browser as a download), the address,
   randomBytes, the modifier keys, the cursor, an audio clip that it plays
   (the samples the browser was given must be the clip's), a player that
   plays the clip's file, and a browser widget (its htmlText, a page of
   the site and "do ... in widget" each call a handler of its
   javascriptHandlers). An IDE without CEF (Linux arm64)
   has no browser widget, so neither has the standalone that it builds:
   the probe then writes "PROBE info browser-widget not loaded" instead of
   that check. Last come the externals that the web engine has: an XML
   tree read with revXML and transformed with XSLT, a zip archive written
   and read back with revZip, and an SQLite database with revDB, whose
   error for a missing table must reach the script as revDB's error (SQLite
   throws a C++ exception for it), and another in the probe's documents
   folder, whose row the browser's storage (IndexedDB) must have soon after
   the probe is ready (in /openxtalk's database: the home folder's name
   since 0.2.7-rc.6.2; then the page opens in a new browser profile whose
   database for /livecode, the old name, has a file, which must be copied
   to /openxtalk's). The builder includes them because the
   probe's scripts use them, and web-deploy.livecodescript names them when
   it builds without the IDE. Then encrypt and decrypt, with the OpenSSL
   that the web engine links: AES with a key and an IV, and Blowfish (of
   OpenSSL's legacy provider) with a password and a salt, which must give
   the desktop engines' bytes, and the cipherNames. Last, revSpeech, which
   speaks with the browser's speech synthesis: this script gives the page
   three voices of its own (headless Chromium has none), one named in
   Japanese, and the probe lists them (all, the female and the male), sets
   the one named in Japanese with a speed, pitch and volume, and speaks a
   text with an e acute and a euro sign, which the browser must be asked to
   say with that voice at the Web Speech API's rate, pitch and volume for
   those (3, 0.5 and 0.5). Then it prints: two pages to the browser, the
   first landscape, which the browser must be asked to print once, each
   page's picture on paper of its size (in the frame that prints, this
   script's print() stands in for the print dialog, and Chromium's PDF of
   that frame's document must have the two pages at their sizes); a job
   that it cancels, which prints nothing; with "open printing to pdf", a
   PDF in /downloads, which must reach the browser as a download and have
   the two pages' pictures, a link to a URL, an anchor and a link to it,
   two bookmarks and the document information that the probe gave; and
   with the printerOutput set to "file:", a PDF of a page in its documents
   folder. When the probe writes "PROBE ready", this
   script clicks the button, types "abc" into the field, and calls the
   stack's handlers from the page (document.liveCode.findStackWithName):
   probeFromJS(21) must return 42, probeReport() "abc|abc|1", and
   probeReport("keys"), with Shift held down, "down|65505". It taps the
   button with a finger, which must be one more click (the browser makes
   up no mouse events of its own after the touch's), and drags a finger
   across the graphic, which must send it mouseDown, mouseMove and mouseUp
   at the finger's points (probeReport("drag")). It drags one field onto
   another with the mouse: the first's dragStart gives the drag a text,
   which the second, an unlocked field, must take, with dragEnter,
   dragDrop and the first's dragEnd (probeReport("dnd")), and the cursor
   over it must say that a drop copies. It drops a file on the graphic
   "Drop Zone" as if from another application (through Chromium's DevTools
   protocol), which must get the path of its copy in /uploads, with the
   file's text (probeReport("drop")). It taps the field with a finger,
   which must bring up a touch screen's keyboard when the touch ends (the
   page gets a VirtualKeyboard API of this script's, as headless Chromium
   has none), and types into it with that keyboard: text with no keys of
   its own and a Backspace, which must reach the field as keys, and the
   keyboard must go away when the field loses the focus (probeUnfocus).
   It holds the mouse down on the graphic "Mouse Zone", whose mouseDown
   loops while the mouse is down and then waits until the mouseClick: the
   loop must see the mouse move and its button go up, and the wait must
   end on a click, with its clickLoc (probeReport("mouse")). With the
   mouse over the graphic, the probe takes snapshots of the page: of the
   graphic by the stack's window, of the whole stack by its rect on the
   screen at half its size, and of the graphic as a PNG, which must have
   the colours drawn, and the mouseColor must be the graphic's
   (probeReport("snapshot")). Then "import snapshot" with no rectangle,
   for which this script drags one out on the graphic over the page,
   must take it, and a second must fail when Escape cancels it. It opens
   a modal dialog (probeReport("modal")): a click on the button under it,
   a click on the field under it and typing must reach neither, the
   dialog's field must take what is typed into it, and its OK button must
   close it; then typing must reach the field again, and a click the
   button. It opens a palette (probeReport("window")): the page must give
   its window a title bar with its title and make it as see-through as
   its blendLevel says, a click on its close box must go through it while
   its ignoreMouseEvents is true, a drag by the title bar must move it
   (moveStack), and a click on the title bar's close box must close it
   (closeStackRequest, closeStack). It has an option menu
   (probeReport("menu")): a click on its button must open its list, and a
   click on the page outside every window must close it with no menuPick,
   twice.
   Then it takes a screenshot of the stack and checks the colours of the
   card, the graphic and the image in it.

The URLs are loaded by the engine, or by the Internet library (libURL)
when the standalone has it: the IDE's builder adds it, with its web
driver, to a stack whose scripts use URLs. The probe reports which ("PROBE
info url-path"), and each has results of its own for a missing page and a
load (see web-probe.livecodescript). A standalone made without the IDE must
use the engine, and one that the IDE made, libURL.

--browser is the browser that opens the page: chromium (the default),
firefox or webkit (Safari's engine), each Playwright's own build. Three
steps drive the browser through Chromium's DevTools protocol, which the
others have not got, and are left out in them, each with a line that says
so: the finger dragged across the graphic, the file dropped from outside
the page, and the paper that the frame which prints is printed on (a PDF
that only Chromium makes). Everything else is checked in all three.

Every check must pass, and nothing may reach the browser's error console
or the page's error handler. The screenshot is written to
<work>/WebProbe.png. --keep-serving keeps the server running after the
checks (Ctrl-C ends it), to open the page in a browser by hand.

Exit status 0 when everything passes, 1 otherwise. Under GitHub Actions
it writes annotations and a job summary. Needs Python 3.8 or later and,
for the browser, the Python package playwright with its browser
(python3 -m playwright install chromium, firefox or webkit).
