"""Watch the windows that come and go while the IDE starts, and name
every window that showed and was taken away again: the "ghost windows" of
a start (LittleNemo, openxtalk.org p=25967: "a succession of fleeting
windows" before the IDE settles).

  python3 tools/ci/startup_windows.py --seconds 60 --log FILE
      [--ready FILE] [--display :91] [--process NAME]
      [--launch PROGRAM [ARGUMENT ...]]

On Linux it follows the window manager's list of the windows it manages
(_NET_CLIENT_LIST on the root window, which openbox, xfwm4 and mutter
keep), so it sees what a user sees: a window that is mapped, framed and
given a place in the taskbar, however briefly. Needs python3-xlib.

On Windows it hears each top-level window of the IDE's process shown,
hidden and destroyed (SetWinEventHook, EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW, _HIDE and
_DESTROY), menus and tooltips aside. On macOS it asks for the windows on
the screen every few milliseconds (CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo) and keeps
the IDE's below the menu bar's level, so menus, the menu bar and tooltips
aside; a window that is up for less than that can be missed. Both through
ctypes alone. Which process is the IDE's: --process names it (the
program's file name, as "OXT-Beyond"), or --launch starts it once the
watch has begun and stops it at the end (on Windows, --launch only).

A window that went is a ghost, unless it is the splash, which is meant
to go, or another window of the IDE's came in its place at once (on
Windows, where the engine makes a stack's window anew when its
decorations change: a "RECREATED" line, RECREATED_WITHIN). Each change is a line of the log: the time in seconds since the
watch began, "+" for a window that came or "-" for one that went, its id
and its title. Then a summary, and one "GHOST" line for each window that
went; with --launch, an "ENDED" line if the program ended before the
watch did. The exit status is 1 when there was a ghost, 2 when the
launched program ended early (and no ghost), 0 otherwise. --ready names a
file written once the watch has begun, so the IDE starts only after that.

The start checks run it beside the IDE: tools/ci/linux_ide_start.sh,
tools/ci/mac_ide_start.sh, and on Windows the step "Start the IDE" of
.github/workflows/build-windows.yml, with --launch.
