# Generate the documentation data of the IDE into the checkout, as
# LiveCode's build machines did before packaging. Git keeps none of it
# (ide/.gitignore): the .lcdoc and Markdown files are its only sources, and
# tools/oxt/package.py packages nothing without it.
#
#   tools/ci/build_docs.sh <work folder> [<build output folder>]
#
# 1. LiveCode's docs builder (builder/builder_tool.livecodescript --stage
#    docs) makes LiveCode's Dictionary and the guides from docs/,
#    ide/Documentation/guides, ide/Documentation/dictionary,
#    mergjson/mergJSON.lcdoc and the LiveCode Builder modules of
#    libscript/ and engine/.
# 2. tools/ci/extension_docs.livecodescript makes the dictionary data of the
#    extensions that OXT-Beyond installs and of the IDE library, as the IDE
#    makes it when it loads them (tools/oxt/text_dictionary.py
#    --list-extensions lists them, and fetches the pinned sources of the
#    xTalk Suite extensions of tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json into
#    <work folder>/xtalk; their doc comments are their docs).
# 3. tools/oxt/text_dictionary.py makes the entries of the text dictionary
#    (Preferences > Dictionary) from both, and puts the extensions' data
#    beside LiveCode's for the Dictionary on the web site
#    (tools/pages/build_dictionary.py), which has no IDE to add them.
#
# It writes, in ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data:
#
#   api/api.sqlite                   LiveCode's Dictionary (the IDE adds the
#                                    extensions it loads)
#   api_livecode_script/*.js,
#   api_livecode_builder/*.js        the same, as JSON
#   guide/distributed_guide.js       the guides
#   api/exports/<section>/resaved/,
#   index.txt, substitutions.txt     the text dictionary's entries
#   api_extensions/<api>/*.js        the extensions' data, which the IDE
#                                    does not read (it makes its own when it
#                                    loads them) and the web site's
#                                    Dictionary adds to LiveCode's
#
# and nothing else outside <work folder>.
#
# The docs run on the development engine of <build output folder>: a Linux
# build's linux-<arch>-bin, or a macOS build's Release folder. Without one,
# the script downloads the Linux x86_64 engine of an OXT-Beyond release
# (DOCS_ENGINE_* below), checks its SHA-256 and keeps it in <work folder>;
# this works on Linux x86_64 only, which includes WSL on Windows. The CI
# builds use that engine (.github/workflows/docs.yml), so that every
# platform's package gets the same data while the engines build. The
# engine's modules/lci decide which modules of libscript/ and engine/ are
# documented: only those the engine has. A new module needs a newer pinned
# engine. The script needs curl, xz, sha256sum, zip and Python 3, and the
# engine's "core" libraries of Installer/linux/libraries.txt; it needs no
# screen.
