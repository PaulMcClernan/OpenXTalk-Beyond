"""Check the standalone runtimes of an installed OXT-Beyond, and build
standalones from them and run them.

  python tools/ci/standalone_check.py (--install DIR | --package FILE)
      [--platform P] [--targets own|all] [--log FILE] [--timeout SECONDS]
  python tools/ci/standalone_check.py --engine FILE --runtime PATH
      [--platform P] [--log FILE] [--timeout SECONDS]

--install is an installed layout, as for tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py
(the folder that holds OXT-Beyond.app on macOS, the program folder on
Windows and Linux), tested from a neutral path; --package extracts a
package (the portable zip, the Linux tar.xz) to a temporary folder first.
--platform names the layout (default: this machine's). --engine and
--runtime name a development engine and a standalone engine (or, on macOS,
a Standalone*.app) directly, for a build that is not packaged (the 32-bit
Windows and Linux builds) or to try the deploy step elsewhere (for example
with a Linux build in WSL); --platform then names the runtime's platform
(win-x86, linux-x86, ...).

The targets are the runtimes that the IDE's standalone builder deploys
(revsblibrary revSBEnginePath), by the tools/oxt/package.py platform whose
tables describe their folders (RUNTIMES):

  mac-universal   Runtime/Mac OS X/x64-ARM64/Standalone-blank.app
  win-x86_64      Runtime/Windows/x86-64/Standalone
  win-x86         Runtime/Windows/x86-32/Standalone
  linux-x86_64    Runtime/Linux/x86-64/Standalone
  linux-x86       Runtime/Linux/x86-32/Standalone
  linux-arm64     Runtime/Linux/arm64/Standalone

--targets own (the default) takes the layout's own platform's runtime;
--targets all every one of them that the layout has (a package's runtimes
for the other platforms come from the runtimes asset, see
tools/oxt/make_runtimes_asset.py). Android standalones are built with the
Android SDK and are not checked here.

1. The runtime folders.

   macOS (the layout's own, tools/oxt/package.py MAC_RUNTIMES): each
   folder holds its Standalone*.app with Contents/MacOS/Standalone-
   Community (the name revSBEnginePath builds from the edition) holding
   every architecture of the layout, an Info.plist whose
   LSMinimumSystemVersion is the lowest minimum macOS of that engine (the
   builder copies it into every standalone), the icons the builder copies
   into every Mac standalone (x86-32: Standalone.icns and
   StandaloneDoc.icns), its Support files, and Externals whose
   Externals.txt and Database Drivers.txt name only bundles that are
   there; each Standalone*.app passes "codesign --verify --strict" when
   codesign exists.

   Windows and Linux (package.py's tables of that platform): the
   Standalone engine, its Support files (revpdfprinter, revsecurity), every
   external and database driver that Externals.txt and Database
   Drivers.txt name and, when the browser external is listed, the CEF
   library are there, and each is a PE (Windows) or ELF (Linux) file built
   for the runtime's architecture.

2. A standalone from each target's runtime: the layout's development
   engine runs tools/ci/standalone-deploy.livecodescript, which saves a
   one-handler stack and attaches it to a copy of the runtime with
   "_internal deploy" (macosx, windows or linux), the command
   revStandaloneDeployWithParams uses. Any engine deploys for every
   platform, so a Linux layout also builds its Windows standalones. The
   Mac deployer accepts only the load commands it knows how to move (no
   LC_RPATH, no chained fixups), so this is where a runtime that no
   standalone can be made from fails. The standalone must be a file of
   the runtime's format and architecture (Mach-O: every slice of the
   runtime). On macOS the copy is then signed as the IDE signs it
   (codesign --deep --force --sign -, performAdHocCodesign) and must pass
   "codesign --verify --deep --strict". It runs when this machine can run
   it (the same operating system; on Windows both architectures, on Linux
   this machine's), with -ui, and must report the engine's version, the
   processor it was built for (for Mach-O, the slice that ran), its
   platform (MacOS, Win32 or Linux) and the environment "command line"
   (what a standalone reports without a user interface; the development
   engine says "development command line"). A runtime from the runtimes
   asset may instead report the version that the asset's PROVENANCE file
   in the layout records for it (asset_versions): the asset is built from
   an earlier commit, and when the engine's version text changes (as it
   did to 9.7.1-BeyondEngine for 0.2.7-rc.6.12) its runtimes keep the old
   text until the asset is rebuilt. That is reported, not failed, as the
   features below are: "Tag a release" refuses while the asset is older
   than the engine's source and the version file (runtimes_provenance.py
   --fail-on-stale, MOD-D1), so a release never ships one. Any other
   version still fails, and so does every version but the engine's when
   the layout has no PROVENANCE file for the asset.

   It then answers, in FEATURE lines, whether its engine has a few
   changes made since the runtimes asset was built that a script can see
   without a user interface (standalone-deploy.livecodescript
   featureProbes). The layout's own runtime, built from this commit, must
   have them all; a runtime of another platform, from the runtimes asset,
   is reported and not failed (the modernization plan's MOD-03, the
   evidence for rebuilding the asset, MOD-D1).

What this does not do is run the IDE's builder itself
(revSaveAsStandalone), which also copies the externals and database
drivers the stack needs from the runtime's Externals folder and warns when
one is missing; that needs the IDE's libraries loaded in a headless
engine, and is left for later (see tools/oxt/README.md).

Exit status 0 when everything passes, 1 otherwise. Under GitHub Actions
it writes annotations and a job summary. Only the Python 3 standard
library is used (3.8 or later).
