extract unpacks a package as tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py does (modes and
symbolic links kept) and prints the folder to give --install, and with
--env NAME also writes NAME=<folder> to $GITHUB_ENV.

overlay puts this checkout's Android builder (OVERLAY) into an installed
OXT-Beyond (a released one), over the files of the same names, so that the
release's IDE runs the changed builder, and the comparison is of the
builders alone, with the same engine and runtimes. --classes also puts a
Java layer (tools/ci/android_java.py build) in place of the release's
Runtime/Android/Classes. --engine puts a runtime folder that
tools/ci/build-android.sh wrote (the engine built here with a current NDK)
in place of the release's Android runtime: each architecture's engine and
externals over the release's, which must all be there, so that no package
mixes the two engines, and the Java layer built with them and the files
beside it.

ide starts the IDE as a user starts it (as tools/ci/web_check.py does, under
xvfb-run on Linux without a DISPLAY) with tools/ci/android-check.livecodescript
named on its command line. That script runs the units of the builder's new
handlers, which need no Android SDK, and with --sdk builds the probe stack
five times with the builder (see BUILDS) into <work>/out/<name>.apk, and the
bundle build's App Bundle beside it (<name>.aab), for which the builder
downloads bundletool once (the jar it keeps is copied to <work>/
bundletool.jar, for verify and device); with
--device it also does what the IDE's Test does for that device. Its lines go
to <work>/android-check.txt, which this prints. The release build is signed
with a keystore made here with the JDK's keytool (<work>/check.keystore).
--stack gives a probe stack file saved by an earlier run, so that two
builders build the same stack (the stack goes into the engine library).
--no-units is for a released builder, which has none of the units'
handlers. --probe java builds the Java layer's probe instead
(AndroidJavaProbe.livecode: it schedules and cancels a local notification
before it turns green, and turns FAIL_COLOR when the call answers none).

verify checks each package in <work>/out against BUILDS and the lines the
IDE wrote: the architectures it has, the signature (apksigner, and the APK
Signing Block that v2 and v3 signatures live in), zipalign, resources.arsc
stored and aligned (Android 11 and newer refuse it compressed for apps that
target API 30 and newer), every activity, service and receiver with an
intent-filter saying android:exported (Android 12 and newer refuse the app
otherwise), the 64-bit engine libraries aligned for 16 KB pages, the
package name and target API, and the builder's warnings. A bundle build's
App Bundle (verify_bundle) must hold what its package holds, keep the
native libraries compressed and the assets stored in the device's
packages, be signed by the package's signer (the JDK's jarsigner and
keytool: --jdk, or those on the PATH), and with <work>/bundletool.jar
(which must be the version the builder pins) say the package name and
target API in its manifest; no other build may leave an App Bundle.
With --engine DIR (the folder overlay --engine took), each package's
engine must be the one built there for its architecture: the same code
(the .text section, which the builder's deploy leaves as it is when it
writes the stack into the .project section).

compare checks that two sets of packages (the released builder's and the
changed one's, of the same probe stack) hold the same files with the same
bytes, apart from what the change meant to change: the signatures (see
EXPECTED_SIGNING) and, in the debug build, the push receiver's
android:exported (see EXPECTED_MANIFEST). Every difference is printed.

device installs a package on a device or emulator with adb (an App Bundle,
<name>.aab, as Google Play does: the device's split APKs that bundletool,
--bundletool, makes of it with the JDK's java, --jdk, and installs), starts it and
waits until the screen is the probe's green (kRunColor in
android-check.livecodescript), which only the probe's openStack makes: the
engine loaded, opened the stack and ran its script. The Java layer's
probe's FAIL_COLOR ends the wait too, as a failure: its script ran and a
call into the Java layer failed. With --allow PERMISSION the probe must
ask for that runtime permission: the wait goes on past its green until
Android's dialog asking for it is in front (dumpsys activity), its Allow
button is tapped (found in a uiautomator dump), and afterwards the package
must hold the permission (dumpsys package). Another app's "isn't
responding" dialog over the probe, or over that dialog, is answered with
its Wait button (at most ANR_TAPS times). The screen is saved as
a PNG (--out), and the probe's own lines in the device's log are searched
for its crash (the engine's caught attempt at an SSL library the package
does not hold is expected, and only then: crash_lines). When it is not
running, crashed or was started more than once, it prints the logs'
account of its processes, what Android did to it that the carried runtime
does not survive (paused for sleep, a changed ApplicationInfo, a relaunch),
how each process ended (dumpsys activity exit-info) and the memory left.

boot waits until an emulator has booted (adb sees it and
sys.boot_completed is 1), saying where it is every minute. It gives up
at --minutes, or within seconds once no emulator runs and adb has no such
device, and then prints what might say why: whether the emulator still
runs, /dev/kvm, adb's devices, the free disk and the end of the emulator's
log (--log), which otherwise only reaches the workflow's artifact. With
--settle it then waits, and says for what, until a fresh image's first
minute's work is done (settle): broadcast queues idle, the package
manager idle, the enabled overlays unchanged, each waiting through a
system server that is not serving, and says if that server restarted.
With --awake, first, it puts the device to sleep once, so that what
Android keeps until the screen is off is done, wakes it, dismisses the
keyguard and keeps it awake (awake).

Exit status 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise. Only the Python 3
standard library is used (3.8 or later), with the Android SDK's adb,
apksigner, aapt and zipalign, and for an App Bundle the JDK's java,
jarsigner and keytool, and bundletool.
