"""The paths-ignore lists of the three build workflows: a change to a file
that a platform's build uses must start that build.

Each build workflow skips a push or pull request that changes only files of
its paths-ignore list (what only the other platforms use, and what builds
nothing). This checks every list against what the workflow names: the
workflow file itself, the workflows of the repository it calls (a job's
"uses: ./.github/workflows/<file>", such as docs.yml) and those they call,
every file of tools/ci that any of them names, and every file of tools/ci
that those name in turn (an import, a script it runs, a baseline it
reads), none of which may be in the list. It also checks that push and
pull_request share the list, and that every entry of the list matches a
file, so that a renamed file does not leave a stale entry behind.
