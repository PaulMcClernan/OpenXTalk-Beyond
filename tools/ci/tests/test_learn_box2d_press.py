"""Learn Box2D grabs the body where the mouse was pressed, read from its
builder (tools/examples/learn-box2d.livecodescript).

A press is handled a moment after it is made. Until 0.2.7-rc.6.17 the Lab
(and the Dragging, Rays and Terrain cards) looked for a body under the
mouse as it was when the press was handled, the mouseLoc, which the engine
asks the screen for there and then. On a busy machine the mouse had moved
on by then: the press grabbed nothing, and "a dragged body follows the
mouse" failed now and then in the Linux package job (Hinges, Bodies). They
now use the clickLoc, kept from the press itself. The real-mouse check in
tools/examples/learn-box2d-clicks.py holds the engine while it presses and
drags (its "pressed while the window is busy" checks), which fails every
time without this; this catches the code going back on every pull request,
without an engine.
