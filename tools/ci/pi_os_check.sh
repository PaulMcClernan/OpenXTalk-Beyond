# Install and start the Linux arm64 package the way a Raspberry Pi owner
# does, on a Raspberry Pi OS-like system: a Debian (bookworm or trixie)
# arm64 container with the Raspberry Pi archive (archive.raspberrypi.com)
# added and upgraded from, as Raspberry Pi OS is. No real Pi has run the
# package; this is the nearest thing CI has (see .github/workflows/
# pi-os-check.yml, which runs it natively on GitHub's ARM runners and under
# QEMU as the Pi 3, Pi 4 and Pi 5 CPUs, Cortex-A53, A72 and A76, whose
# older instruction sets the ARM runners' Neoverse CPUs hide).

#
# Runs as root in the container (it installs packages and adds a user)
# and does, in order:
#   1. adds the Raspberry Pi archive for this Debian release and upgrades
#      (PI_REPO=0 leaves it out);
#   2. installs only what the install instructions name (unzip, xz-utils
#      and GTK 2: libgtk2.0-0, or libgtk2.0-0t64 on trixie), unpacks the
#      package as an ordinary user, and checks that the launcher finds
#      every library it needs: the instructions are enough;
#   3. installs the screen and window manager the check needs, with the
#      Raspberry Pi desktop's GTK theme when the archive has it, and starts
#      the IDE with tools/ci/linux_ide_start.sh as that user;
#   4. runs install.sh and the uninstall script it installs, as that user.
# The output folder gets each step's output and the IDE's screenshots.
# Exit status 0 when every step passed.
