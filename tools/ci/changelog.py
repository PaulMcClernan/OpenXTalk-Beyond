"""The changelog fragments of changelog/, and folding them into
CHANGELOG.md.

  python3 tools/ci/changelog.py check
  python3 tools/ci/changelog.py fold [--dry-run]

Every pull request used to add its lines to the end of the "Unreleased"
section of CHANGELOG.md, so each merge left every other open pull request
in conflict on that one file, and the merge of main that settled it built
all three platforms again. Now a pull request writes its lines to a file
of its own, changelog/<name>.md (any name no other pull request uses:
its branch's with any "/" made a "-", or its number once it has
one), in CHANGELOG.md's own form,
one "- " line per change ending with the pull request's number:

  - Tools palette: long names shrink or wrap instead of being cut off (#168)

check (CI checks, on every pull request and push): changelog/ holds
only .md files (a folder, as a branch name with a "/" would make, is an
error, since fold would miss it), every fragment holds at least one line, every line that is not empty starts with "- ", none is
a heading, and CHANGELOG.md has at most one "## Unreleased" section.

fold (the pull request that sets a release's version, before it renames
"## Unreleased" to the version; BUILDING.md, "Making a release"): appends
the fragments' lines to the end of "## Unreleased" (made above the newest
release's section when there is none), in the order the fragments came
into main (the first-parent commit that added each, from git: a merge
commit counts when it was merged, not when its branch was written; by
name when git cannot tell, as in a shallow clone), and deletes the
fragments. So
CHANGELOG.md reads exactly as it did when the lines were added to it by
hand. changelog/README.md is not a fragment. Only the Python 3 standard
library is used.
