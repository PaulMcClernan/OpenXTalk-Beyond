"""How far the runtimes asset is behind the engine's source.

    python3 tools/ci/runtimes_provenance.py [--repo DIR] [--assets FILE]
        [--fail-on-stale] [--list N]

A package's standalone runtimes for the platforms other than its own come
from the runtimes asset (tools/oxt/external-assets.json, the asset whose id
begins oxt-runtimes-), which was built from one commit of this repository
(its "source" says which). Every runtime reports the same version and build
number whatever commit it was built from until the file version changes it,
so a standalone check cannot tell an old runtime from a new one
(modernization report MOD-01). This lists the commits since the asset's
that changed the engine's source or the version file (SOURCE_PATHS), the
changes those runtimes do not have.

By default it only reports: the list goes to standard output and, under
GitHub Actions, to the job summary with a warning, and the exit status is 0
however many commits there are (the CI checks run it so: failing there
would turn every pull request red after an engine change). --fail-on-stale
makes it exit 1 when there is any; the "Tag a release" workflow runs it so
(seth's decision MOD-D1, 2026-10-31: every release rebuilds the asset),
and a release is not tagged until a new asset is pinned. Exit status 2
when the asset or its commit cannot be found, or the history does not
reach the commit (a shallow clone: check out with fetch-depth 0).

The Android runtime in the asset is carried over from oxt-runtimes-1.15
and is not built from any commit here: the report says so and counts
nothing for it.
