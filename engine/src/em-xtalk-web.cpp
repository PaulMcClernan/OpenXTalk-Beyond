/* The xTalk Suite's native libraries in the web IDE (EXPERIMENTAL).
 *
 * On the desktop an LCB extension that binds to "c:sodiumxt>sxt_hash" makes
 * the engine open code/<platform>/sodiumxt.dll (.so, .dylib). A browser
 * opens no library, so the web IDE's engine (engine.gyp's development-web,
 * and only it: the web standalone engine does not compile this file) links
 * the libraries into itself and registers each one here under the name
 * the extension loads it by, as em-externals.cpp registers revXML and the
 * other externals. libfoundation/src/system-library-emscripten.hpp then
 * finds "sodiumxt" by that name, and its symbols in its table.
 *
 * Each library comes from its member of the xTalk Suite as
 * src/code/wasm32-emscripten/<name>.a, pinned in
 * tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json ("web_libraries"): one object with the
 * library and a function, <name>_web_exports, that returns the table of
 * every symbol the member's .lcb binds to (the member generates it from
 * the .lcb). DataChannelXT's is not libdatachannel, which needs sockets a
 * page does not have, but the same functions over the browser's own WebRTC
 * (the suite's datachannelxt/src/datachannel_web.cpp).
 * tools/web-ide/xtalk_web_libraries.py fetches the pinned
 * archives, makes every other symbol of each object local (so two members
 * that carry the same vendored code, trezor-crypto's in SodiumXT and
 * CoinXT, cannot clash), and util/emscripten-javascriptify.py links the
 * objects into the web IDE's engine.
 *
 * The functions are declared weak: an engine linked without a library (a
 * local build that did not fetch them) has a null address for its function,
 * and that library is simply not registered, so its extension's first call
 * fails as it does in the released web IDE. The table's layout is
 * MCSLibraryStaticExport's: { symbol, address } pairs, ended by a null
 * symbol. */
