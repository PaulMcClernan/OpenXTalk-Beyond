// of keys and values, "{<key>: <value>, ...}". Each key and value is any
// expression, worked out each time the literal is; a comma may follow the
// last, and "[]" and "{}" are an empty array. A key the same as an earlier
// one, as the caseSensitive says, gives that element its value, as "put"
// into the element would. "[" and "{" begin no expression otherwise, so
// the parser reads one only where what holds it did not compile without
// it (MCNewSyntax): every script that compiled before compiles as it did.
// It reads none in text worked out only if it compiles, and left as text
// otherwise, a merge template's or a parameter of send given as text
// (MCScriptPoint::m_literal_arrays), so that such text is left as it was
