	X11Audio : Provides an abstraction between the aclip object and a Linux based audio system.
	This uses EsounD (which comes installed as part of GNOME). However, this interface will be
    simple enough to allow us to plug in any sound engine (OSS, ALSA).

	OXT-Beyond: current distributions ship no EsounD, so a clip plays through PulseAudio
	(or PipeWire's Pulse server) as a stream when libpulse-simple can be loaded and a server
	answers; the EsounD path is used, as before, only when there is no stream.
