/* ================================================================
 * Emscripten Handle Class
 * ================================================================ */

/* The __MCSLibraryHandleEmscripten class stands for one of two things. A
 * handle made with an address notionally represents the main executable,
 * in which it finds the symbols registered with MCSLibraryRegisterStaticMain
 * (a browser cannot look a function up by name). A handle made with a
 * native path is one of
 * the libraries that the web engine links into itself (a browser loads
 * none) and registers with MCSLibraryRegisterStatic: as on iOS
 * (system-library-static.hpp), the library is found by the name of its file
 * without the folder and the extension, so "<folder>/revxml.so" finds the
 * library registered as "revxml", and its symbols are those it registered.
 * OXT-Beyond: the registry is new; before it, a handle made with a path
 * was never made, and the main executable had no symbols. */
