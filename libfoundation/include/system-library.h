 * Construction and querying
 * ================================================================ */

/* Create an MCSLibraryRef object by loading the library from the specified
 * path.
 *
 * If the path is absolute, then only an attempt to load that specific library
 * will be made. If the path is relative, however, an attempt to load the
 * library will use the system's default search order.
 *
 * On Mac, bundles, frameworks and dylibs are supported. In order to load a
 * bundle, an absolute path must be supplied. Otherwise, if the path ends in
 * <LEAF>.framework then the path will be modified to end in
 * <LEAF>.framework/<LEAF>. In the dylib and framework case, dlopen's default
 * search strategy is used.
 *
 * On Windows, dlls are supported. They are loaded using LoadLibraryEx with
 * the LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH flag set.
 *
 * On Linux, shared objects (.so) are supported. They are loaded using dlopen's
 * search strategy.
 *
 * On Android, shared objects (.so) are supported. They are loaded using
 * dlopen's search strategy which requires that non-system libraries be loaded
 * using absolute paths (otherwise they can fail to load).
 *
 * On iOS, only statically linked and registered objects are supported. The
 * name is matched exactly with the name specified in the static registration
 * record. */
