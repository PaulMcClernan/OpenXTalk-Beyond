# Building OXT-Beyond

This guide builds OXT-Beyond for 64-bit Windows (x86_64) from source,
packages it and makes its installer, using the same tools and commands
as the project's CI build. OXT-Beyond is also built, packaged and
released for macOS (one universal app for Apple Silicon and Intel) and
Linux x86-64, by their CI workflows; [Building on Linux](#12-building-on-linux)
and [Building on macOS](#13-building-on-macos) describe what those
workflows do, and [Making a release](#10-making-a-release) how one tag
releases all three. Every package also has the web engine, which runs
the HTML5 standalones that the IDE makes; it is built on Linux, and
[Building the web engine](#14-building-the-web-engine) describes it.
The upstream LiveCode instructions for other platforms are still in
`docs/development/`, but they are not maintained for this project.

The engine build needs a legacy toolchain: the Visual Studio 2017 C++
compiler (toolset v141, installed as an optional part of Visual Studio
2022), Python 2.7 and Cygwin. That is what the engine's build files and
the prebuilt third-party libraries were made for. Moving to current
tools is planned but has not been done yet. Packaging needs Python 3,
and the installer needs Inno Setup 6.

What you get from the build is a `win-x86_64-bin` folder with the
engines, externals and tools, and an IDE you can run straight from your
clone. The files in it are still named after LiveCode
(`LiveCode-Community.exe`). Packaging turns them, the IDE and the
standalone runtimes for other platforms into OXT-Beyond's installed
layout, with the development engine renamed `OXT-Beyond.exe`, and from
that the portable zip and the installer.

## 1. Quick reference

Once the tools in section 2 are installed, a build is (in `cmd.exe`):

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond.git C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
cd /d C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1
set PATH=C:\Python27;%PATH%
C:\Python27\python.exe config.py --platform win-x86_64
cd build-win-x86_64
cmd /c ..\make.cmd
cd ..
win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe
```

and, to make the packages and the installer (section 7; this needs
Python 3, Inno Setup 6 and, for the documentation, WSL):

```bat
wsl bash tools/ci/build_docs.sh /tmp/oxt-docs
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\package-windows.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\build-installer.ps1
```

The second line builds the prebuilt third-party libraries (OpenSSL,
curl, ICU and those of `thirdparty/`) once, in about 40 minutes (section
6); later builds reuse them.

Allow several gigabytes of disk space. On an existing tree the clone
(files and Git history) took about 0.8 GB, the prebuilt archives
0.3 GB, the unpacked prebuilt libraries 1.5 GB, the build folder 3.5 GB
and `win-x86_64-bin` 0.5 GB; building the prebuilt libraries needs a few
GB more in `prebuilt\build\windows`, which you can delete afterwards.
Packaging needs about 1 GB more for `dist\stage`, 0.2 GB for the
downloaded runtimes and about 0.6 GB for the zips, plus the installer.

A first build compiles everything, one project at a time, and takes a
long while. Later builds only rebuild what changed.

## 2. Install the tools

| Tool | Version | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visual Studio 2022 (Build Tools or any edition) | with the v141 toolset, ATL, MFC and a Windows 10/11 SDK | default location |
| Python | 2.7.18, 64-bit | `C:\Python27` |
| Strawberry Perl | any recent 64-bit release | default location, on `PATH` |
| Git for Windows | any recent release | default location |
| Cygwin | 64-bit, with flex, bison, make and a few other packages | `C:\cygwin64`, **not** on `PATH` |
| NASM (for the prebuilt libraries) | any recent release | `C:\Program Files\NASM` or on `PATH` |
| CMake (for the prebuilt libraries) | 3.20 or later | on `PATH`, or Visual Studio's "C++ CMake tools for Windows" |
| Python 3 (for packaging) | 3.8 or later | any; found as `py -3`, `python3` or `python` |
| Inno Setup (for the installer) | 6.3 or later | default location |

You do not need the Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1 that the old upstream
instructions mention, or the QuickTime SDK that `config.py` looks for.
The old instructions also asked for the Windows 8.1 SDK, and the only
earlier build of this code that is known to work (Tom Perry's) did
compile against the Windows 8.1 SDK headers. This guide and CI use a
Windows 10/11 SDK instead; a complete build with one has not been
confirmed yet. If you get compile errors in Windows SDK headers, see
[Troubleshooting](#8-troubleshooting).

### 2.1 Visual Studio 2022 with the v141 toolset

The generated projects use the VS 2017 C++ toolset (`v141`), and the
prebuilt libraries were compiled with it. Visual Studio 2022 can install
it as an optional component. You need these components:

| Component ID | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64` | current MSVC x64/x86 build tools (brings MSBuild and `vcvarsall.bat`) |
| `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.x86.x64` | MSVC v141 (VS 2017) x64/x86 build tools, version 14.16 |
| `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.ATL` | ATL for v141 (the engine and revBrowser use ATL) |
| `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.MFC` | MFC for v141 (revBrowser's resource file includes `afxres.h`) |
| `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.17763` | Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0 |

Another Windows 10 or 11 SDK can be used instead; see `WINSDK_VERSION`
in [section 5](#5-build). (As noted above, no complete build with a
Windows 10/11 SDK has been confirmed yet.) SDK 10.0.17763.0 is selected
because it supports the VS 2017-era v141 compiler and is much closer to
the generated projects' original 10.0.14393.0 target than current SDKs.

**New install of the Build Tools.** Download
[`vs_BuildTools.exe`](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)
and run, from a command prompt in the download folder:

```bat
vs_BuildTools.exe --passive --wait --norestart ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.x86.x64 ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.ATL ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.MFC ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.17763
```

**Existing Visual Studio 2022.** Add the components to it. Change
`--installPath` to your installation (for example
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community`):

```bat
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe" modify ^
  --installPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools" ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.x86.x64 ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.ATL ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.v141.MFC ^
  --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.17763 ^
  --passive --norestart
```

You can also tick the same items in the Visual Studio Installer under
*Modify > Individual components*: "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build
tools (Latest)", "MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)",
"C++ ATL for v141 build tools (x86 & x64)", "C++ MFC for v141 build
tools (x86 & x64)" and "Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)". The CI build uses
[`tools/ci/install-vs-components.ps1`](tools/ci/install-vs-components.ps1),
which you can also run from an elevated PowerShell prompt; add
`-VerifyOnly` to check an installation without changing it.

Microsoft documents the component IDs in
[Visual Studio Build Tools component directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/workload-component-id-vs-build-tools?view=vs-2022)
and the installer options in
[Use command-line parameters to install Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022).

### 2.2 Python 2.7

`config.py` and the bundled copy of gyp only run on Python 2. Install
Python 2.7.18 (64-bit) into `C:\Python27`. It is end of life, but
python.org still hosts the installer:
[python-2.7.18.amd64.msi](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.18/python-2.7.18.amd64.msi)
([release page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)).

```bat
msiexec /i python-2.7.18.amd64.msi /qb ALLUSERS=1 TARGETDIR=C:\Python27
```

You do not have to add it to your system `PATH` (which could upset other
Python software): run `config.py` with `C:\Python27\python.exe`, as
shown in [section 4](#4-configure). Python 3 can stay installed.

### 2.3 Strawberry Perl

Several build steps run `perl` through `cmd.exe` and need a native
Windows Perl. Install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)
(64-bit); its installer adds it to `PATH`. Check in a new command
prompt:

```bat
perl -e "print $^O"
```

This must print `MSWin32`. If it prints `cygwin` or `msys`, another Perl
(for example the one inside Git for Windows or Cygwin) comes first on
`PATH`; move Strawberry Perl ahead of it.

### 2.4 Git for Windows

Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Keep the default
choices, in particular:

- "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" for
  `PATH`. Do not choose the option that also puts Git's Unix tools on
  `PATH`: Git's `usr\bin` contains its own `bash.exe`, `cygpath.exe` and
  `perl.exe`, which can be picked up instead of Cygwin's and Strawberry's.
- "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
  (`core.autocrlf=true`). This is the setup the existing builds used. See
  [line endings](#line-endings) below.

The build calls `git` while configuring, so Git has to be on `PATH`.

### 2.5 Cygwin

Several build steps (fetching the prebuilt libraries, flex and bison for
the LiveCode Builder compiler, the time zone data) run as shell commands
through `util\invoke-unix.bat`, which needs Cygwin. Install the 64-bit
Cygwin into `C:\cygwin64` and do **not** add it to `PATH`.

Download [setup-x86_64.exe](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe) and run:

```bat
setup-x86_64.exe -q -n -R C:\cygwin64 -l C:\cygwin64\packages ^
  -s https://mirrors.kernel.org/sourceware/cygwin/ ^
  -P flex,bison,m4,gawk,sed,grep,curl,tar,bzip2,make
```

`-q` runs unattended, `-n` skips the shortcuts, `-R` sets the install
folder, `-l` the package download folder, `-s` the download mirror (any
mirror from [cygwin.com/mirrors.html](https://cygwin.com/mirrors.html)
will do) and `-P` lists the extra packages. `bash`, `coreutils` and the
rest of the base system are always installed. See the
[Cygwin FAQ](https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.setup.cli) for all
options. To add packages later, run the same command again.

`util\invoke-unix.bat` looks for Cygwin in this order: the folder in the
`CYGPATH` environment variable (the Cygwin root, for example
`set CYGPATH=D:\cygwin64`), then `C:\cygwin64`, then `C:\cygwin`, and
only then a `cygpath.exe` found on `PATH`. The Cygwin path must not
contain spaces.

Check:

```bat
C:\cygwin64\bin\flex.exe --version
C:\cygwin64\bin\bison.exe --version
```

### 2.6 Python 3 (for packaging)

The packaging tools in `tools/oxt/` are Python 3 scripts that use only
the standard library. Install a current Python 3 from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (the installer's
`py` launcher is enough). It does not replace Python 2.7, which
`config.py` still needs: `tools\ci\package-windows.ps1` looks for
`py -3`, then `python3`, then a `python` that is Python 3.8 or later, or
uses the interpreter you give it with `-Python`. Packaging downloads the
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) from `github.com` and
`raw.githubusercontent.com` unless they are in its cache.

### 2.7 Inno Setup 6 (for the installer)

The installer is compiled with Inno Setup 6.3 or later. Install it from
[jrsoftware.org](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) into its default
folder, or with Chocolatey (`choco install innosetup`).
`tools\ci\build-installer.ps1` finds `ISCC.exe` there; if it cannot
find it, it tries to install Inno Setup with Chocolatey itself (see
[Installer](#installer)).

## 3. Get the source

Clone with Git, into a path **without spaces**:

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond.git C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
```

- A "Download ZIP" of the repository will not configure: configuring
  runs `git rev-parse HEAD` to embed the source revision in the engine.
- The only submodule is `libcpptest/googletest`, used by the C++ unit
  tests. If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run
  `git submodule update --init`.
- `ide/` (the IDE) and `thirdparty/` (third-party library sources) are
  ordinary folders in this repository, not submodules. `ide/` holds the
  OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 IDE with its history (see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)).
- The longest path in `ide/` is 142 characters. If you clone into a deep
  folder and Git reports "Filename too long", enable long paths
  (`git config --global core.longpaths true`) or use a shorter folder.
- Paths with spaces break `util\invoke-unix.bat`, which passes the
  current folder to Cygwin unquoted.

## 4. Configure

Configuring runs gyp, which writes Visual Studio project files into
`build-win-x86_64\livecode\` (the solution is `livecode.sln`). In
`cmd.exe`:

```bat
cd /d C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
set PATH=C:\Python27;%PATH%
C:\Python27\python.exe config.py --platform win-x86_64
```

The `set PATH` line only affects this command prompt. It makes `python`
mean Python 2.7 here, which is also how CI runs the build (one build
step runs `python`). Keep using the same prompt for the build.

Double-clicking `configure.bat` does the same thing interactively and
waits for a key press at the end. It uses `C:\Python27\python.exe` if it
exists; set `PYTHON` to use a Python 2.7 installed somewhere else. If
`PYTHON` is set but is not Python 2 (other tools, such as node-gyp, use
the same variable for Python 3), `configure.bat` uses
`C:\Python27\python.exe` instead, or stops with an error if that does
not exist.

Notes:

- The solution file says "Visual Studio 2015". That is expected: this
  old copy of gyp only knows project formats up to 2015. The projects
  themselves use the v141 toolset and build with Visual Studio 2022's
  MSBuild.
- Configuring also writes `debug_syms_inputs.txt` in the repository
  root (a list of the built programs, used by the debug-symbol build
  steps). The
  file came in with Tom Perry's changes and is tracked by Git. It
  normally comes out unchanged; if Git shows it as modified after
  configuring, restore it with `git checkout -- debug_syms_inputs.txt`
  rather than committing the change with unrelated work.
- Run `config.py` again after pulling changes to any `*.gyp` or
  `*.gypi` file. Never edit the generated files under
  `build-win-x86_64` by hand; they are overwritten.

## 5. Build

From the same command prompt:

```bat
cd build-win-x86_64
cmd /c ..\make.cmd
```

`make.cmd` finds Visual Studio, sets up the compiler environment with
`vcvarsall.bat x64`, and runs MSBuild on `livecode\livecode.sln` with
the `default` target. It ends with `exit`, which would close your
command prompt, so run it through `cmd /c` as shown.

MSBuild runs one project at a time (`/m:1`) and writes a full log to
`build-win-x86_64\msbuild.log`. When something fails, search that file
for `error`.

`make.cmd` reads these environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BUILDTYPE` | `Release` | `Release` or `Debug`. |
| `BUILD_PLATFORM` | `win-x86_64` | `win-x86_64`, or `win-x86` for the 32-bit build (into `win-x86-bin`). That one is made for its standalone runtime, `Runtime\Windows\x86-32`, and is not packaged; build its prebuilt libraries first with `prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1 -Arch x86`. |
| `VSINSTALLDIR` | found with `vswhere` | Visual Studio folder to use. Without it, `make.cmd` picks the newest installation that has the v141 toolset component, then a Visual Studio 2017 installation with the C++ build tools, then the newest installation of any version with the C++ build tools. |
| `WINSDK_VERSION` | the SDK that `vcvarsall.bat` selected | Windows SDK version passed to MSBuild as `/p:WindowsTargetPlatformVersion`, for example `10.0.17763.0`. |
| `MSBUILD_EXTRA_ARGS` | empty | Extra arguments added to the end of the MSBuild command line, for example `/v:minimal`. |

For example, a Debug build against a particular SDK:

```bat
set BUILDTYPE=Debug
set WINSDK_VERSION=10.0.17763.0
cmd /c ..\make.cmd
```

`make.cmd` takes an optional MSBuild target as its first argument:

- no argument: the `default` target, which builds everything and copies
  the results into `win-x86_64-bin`;
- `check`: builds and runs the C++ unit tests (Google Test). This has not
  been tried on this fork yet.

The intermediate files go to `build-win-x86_64\livecode\Release` (or
`Debug`). The finished files are copied to `win-x86_64-bin` in the
repository root, whichever build type you choose, so a Debug build
replaces the Release files there.

[`tools/ci/build-windows.ps1`](tools/ci/build-windows.ps1) runs the
configure and build steps with a checked tool setup (Python 2.7 first on
`PATH`, a native Perl, Cygwin through `CYGPATH`, and no other
`cygpath.exe` on `PATH`). CI uses it, and you can too:

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\build-windows.ps1
```

**Visual Studio IDE.** You can open `build-win-x86_64\livecode\livecode.sln`
in Visual Studio 2022 to read and debug the code. Building from inside
Visual Studio is not set up: the generated projects do not name a
Windows SDK, so the v141 toolset looks for the Windows 8.1 SDK and is
expected to fail with MSB8036. `make.cmd` passes the SDK version on the
command line, so build with it.

## 6. Prebuilt libraries

The engine links a set of third-party libraries that are not compiled
during the normal build. They come as prebuilt archives, one for each
library, architecture and configuration:

| Archive | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `OpenSSL-3.5.9-...-PIC` | OpenSSL 3.5.9 (a long-term support release): libcrypto and libssl, static, with OpenSSL's legacy provider built in |
| `Curl-8.22.0-...-PIC` | libcurl 8.22.0, with OpenSSL (the server engine; on macOS the server engine uses the system's libcurl) |
| `ICU-78.3-...-1-PIC` | ICU 78.3, with its full data file, from which the build makes the cut-down copy the engines embed |
| `Thirdparty-e5e050573c...-PIC` | static libraries built from `thirdparty/` (cairo, libffi, giflib, libjpeg, libpng, zlib, libzip, PCRE, Skia, libxml2, libxslt, MySQL Connector/C, libpq, SQLite) |
| `CEF-74.1.19-...-gb62bacf` | Chromium Embedded Framework 74 (Chromium 74.0.3729.157), for the browser widget and revBrowser on Windows (x86_64 and x86) and Linux x86_64 |

The versions are in `prebuilt/versions/`. Every platform builds
OpenSSL, curl, ICU and Thirdparty from source: Linux and macOS with
`prebuilt/build-libraries.sh` and `package-libs.sh` (see
[Building on Linux](#12-building-on-linux) and
[Building on macOS](#13-building-on-macos)), Windows with
`prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1` (below). CEF is not compiled:
Windows and Linux x86_64 repackage Spotify's binary distribution of the
CEF version in `prebuilt/versions/cef*`, as LiveCode's scripts did,
downloaded from <https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com> and checked against
the SHA-1 that Spotify publishes for the file, pinned in
[`prebuilt/cef-sha1sums`](prebuilt/cef-sha1sums)
(`prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1 -Libraries CEF`,
`prebuilt/scripts/build-cef.sh`). macOS has no CEF, and neither has the
32-bit Linux build: CEF's 32-bit Linux builds ended with CEF 101. CI
builds the archives when their versions, scripts or sources change and
keeps them in its cache. Until OXT-Beyond 0.2.1-rc.2, Windows downloaded
LiveCode's archives of all five libraries (OpenSSL 1.1.1g, curl 7.51.0,
ICU 58.2, Thirdparty and CEF 74 for x86_64 only), mirrored in the
[`prebuilts-v1` release](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases/tag/prebuilts-v1),
which stays published for those versions; nothing is downloaded from it
now.

On Windows, `dbsqlite.dll` is compiled from the SQLite source in
`thirdparty/libsqlite` rather than linked from the Thirdparty archive,
as it was while that archive still held SQLite 3.34.0.

### Building them on Windows

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1
```

builds OpenSSL, curl, ICU and Thirdparty for x86_64 Release, repackages
CEF, and writes their archives to `prebuilt\packaged`, where the build's
fetch step finds them. It takes about 40 minutes on a four-core machine. Besides
the tools of section 2 it needs:

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us) (OpenSSL's assembler), in
  `C:\Program Files\NASM` or on `PATH`, for example from
  `choco install nasm`;
- CMake (for curl), which Visual Studio installs with its "C++ CMake
  tools for Windows" component, or any CMake on `PATH`;
- Cygwin's `make` (ICU's build runs under Cygwin with `cl`), which the
  package list of section 2.5 includes.

The compiler is MSVC v141 (14.16), the toolset the engine is built
with: a v141 link cannot take static libraries made by a newer
compiler. The script finds the Visual Studio with the v141 component
(or uses `VSINSTALLDIR`), calls `vcvarsall.bat` with
`-vcvars_ver=14.16` and the Windows SDK in `WINSDK_VERSION`, if set, and
checks that `cl.exe` is MSVC 14.16. OpenSSL is configured with
`no-shared no-module`, so that its static libraries take the C runtime
of whatever links them and the legacy provider (the older ciphers that
`encrypt` offers) is built in; ICU is compiled with `/std:c++17`, which
ICU 75 and later need. Thirdparty is compiled by the engine's own build
files (`config.py` and the msbuild target `thirdparty-prebuilts`,
through `tools\ci\build-windows.ps1`), so it also needs Python 2.7, and
it uses the folder `build-win-x86_64`, which the engine build then
reuses.

Options: `-Libraries` (any of `OpenSSL`, `Curl`, `ICU`, `CEF`,
`Thirdparty`; curl needs the OpenSSL archive in the output folder
first, Thirdparty all four others), `-Arch x86`, `-Mode debug`
(CEF's debug libraries come from Spotify's standard distribution, the
release ones from its smaller "minimal" one), `-OutDir` (default
`prebuilt\packaged`), `-WorkDir` (downloads and build folders, default
`prebuilt\build\windows`), `-CygwinRoot`, `-VsInstallDir` and `-NoAsm`
(OpenSSL without NASM: slower, for trying things out only).

Instead of building them, you can take the archives a CI build made:
every run of the Build (Windows) workflow (see
[Continuous integration](#9-continuous-integration)) uploads them as the
artifact `prebuilt-libraries-win-x86_64` (Release, x86_64, CEF
included). Extract it into `prebuilt\packaged`.

**Debug builds need the debug archives.** Run the script with
`-Mode debug` as well, and set
`PREBUILT_WIN32_SUBPLATFORMS=v141_static_debug v141_static_release`
(below).

### Automatic fetch

The first build runs `prebuilt/fetch-libraries.sh` (through
`util\invoke-unix.bat` and Cygwin), which

1. copies each archive from `prebuilt\packaged` (or the folder in
   `PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR`) into `prebuilt\fetched`; an archive that is not
   there would be downloaded from `PREBUILT_URL`, which has none of the
   current versions, so build them first;
2. checks downloads against [`prebuilt/SHA256SUMS`](prebuilt/SHA256SUMS);
   an archive copied from the local folder is checked too when it has an
   entry there, and is otherwise taken as built locally;
3. unpacks them into `prebuilt\unpacked`.

Later builds reuse what is there. All of these folders are ignored by
Git. An archive in `prebuilt\fetched` is not replaced by a newer one of
the same name in `prebuilt\packaged`: after rebuilding a library with
the same version, delete `prebuilt\fetched` and `prebuilt\unpacked`.

To fetch without building, run the script with Cygwin's bash:

```bat
C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe -lc "cd /cygdrive/c/src/OpenXTalk-Beyond/prebuilt && ./fetch-libraries.sh win32 x86_64"
```

### Settings

`fetch-libraries.sh` reads these optional environment variables. Set
them in the command prompt before running `make.cmd`; they are passed
through to the script.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR` | A folder that holds the `.tar.bz2` files; they are copied from there instead of downloaded. Default: `prebuilt\packaged`, if it exists. A Windows path such as `C:\prebuilts` is fine. |
| `PREBUILT_URL` | Where to download what is not in the local folder. Default: `https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases/download/prebuilts-v1`, which holds LiveCode's archives of the versions before 0.2.1-rc.3 only. |
| `PREBUILT_CACHE_DIR` | Download into this folder instead of `prebuilt\fetched`. |
| `PREBUILT_WIN32_LIBS` | Which libraries to fetch, for example `OpenSSL Curl`. Default: all five. |
| `PREBUILT_WIN32_SUBPLATFORMS` | Which variants to fetch. Default: `v141_static_release`; a Debug build needs `v141_static_debug v141_static_release`. |
| `PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1` | Do not check the SHA-256 sums. Only for testing new archives. |
| `PREBUILT_STRICT=1` | Fail if a downloaded archive has no entry in `prebuilt/SHA256SUMS` (by default that is only a warning). CI sets it. |
| `PREBUILT_SKIP_FETCH=1` | Fetch nothing, because the libraries are already in `prebuilt/` (built there without packaging them, as `tools/ci/build-web.sh` does). |

### Offline use

Build the archives where you have internet access (the script
downloads the source releases and Spotify's CEF distribution), or take
them from a CI run, and copy them into `prebuilt\packaged` on the build
machine (or another folder named by `PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR`).

### Changing the prebuilt libraries

To move a library to a newer release, change its file in
`prebuilt/versions/` (and the build scripts, if its build changed),
build, and run the tests. CI builds the new archives by itself, since
the versions and scripts are part of its cache keys. Update the
versions in [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) with them.

For a new CEF version, also add the SHA-1 lines of its files to
`prebuilt/cef-sha1sums`, as Spotify's `index.json` lists them (Windows
64-bit and 32-bit, minimal and standard, and Linux 64-bit minimal): a
download whose SHA-1 is not listed there, or differs, stops the build.

## 7. Run, check and package the result

### Run the IDE from your clone

```bat
cd /d C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe
```

The development engine sees that it is running from a folder called
`win-x86_64-bin` and loads the IDE from the `ide` folder next to it. It
also uses `ide-support\`, `extensions\script-libraries\`, `docs\` and the
`*.lcb` files in `engine\src` and `libscript\src`, so run it from a
complete checkout. This is the *development layout*; see
[Development and installed layouts](#development-and-installed-layouts)
for how it differs from an installed OXT-Beyond.

The menubar window's title shows "OXT-Beyond" and the version in
`ide/.version`; the build number (*Preferences > Automatic Updates*) is
the placeholder `0` from `ide/.buildnumber`. The IDE uses the same
preference, cache and log folders as an installed OXT-Beyond
(`%APPDATA%\OXT-Beyond`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OXT-Beyond`).

Running the IDE from your clone writes files in it that Git ignores:
`ide/environment_log.txt` and, in
`ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data`, LiveCode's Dictionary
and the guides, which the IDE in this layout generates from `docs/`
and `ide/Documentation/guides` when they are missing or out of date, as
LiveCode's did. The text dictionary (*Preferences > Dictionary*) has no
entries until you [generate the documentation](#documentation).

### Check the build

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\verify-build.ps1
```

[`tools/ci/verify-build.ps1`](tools/ci/verify-build.ps1) checks that the
expected files exist, that `dbsqlite.dll` contains the `SQLITE_SOURCE_ID`
from `thirdparty/libsqlite/include/sqlite3.h` (SQLite 3.51.1), and that
`LiveCode-Community.exe` contains the version from the `version` file.
The same checks by hand:

```bat
findstr /M /C:"9.7.1-OXT" win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe
findstr /M /C:"2025-11-28 17:28:25" win-x86_64-bin\dbsqlite.dll
```

Each command prints the file name if the text is found.

### Smoke test

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\smoke-test.ps1
```

[`tools/ci/smoke-test.ps1`](tools/ci/smoke-test.ps1) starts the
development engine without a user interface (`-ui`) and runs
[`tools/ci/smoke-test.livecodescript`](tools/ci/smoke-test.livecodescript).
It checks the script engine, Unicode handling (ICU), encryption (OpenSSL,
through `revsecurity.dll`), SQLite through revDB (the version must match
`thirdparty/libsqlite/include/sqlite3.h`; FTS5 and JSON must work and
R*Tree must be compiled in), revXML and revZip. In an installed layout
with the [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) it also loads
each of them as the IDE does and calls it (see there). It prints one
line per check and exits with the number of failed checks.

Without options it tests `win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe`. It can
also test the other layouts:

| Option | What is tested |
| --- | --- |
| `-Package dist\OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-portable.zip` | The zip is extracted to a temporary folder and its layout detected: the portable zip is an installed layout, so `OXT-Beyond.exe` in it is tested, with the externals in `Externals` and the database drivers in `Externals\Database Drivers`. A zip with a `win-x86_64-bin` folder is tested as a development layout. |
| `-InstallDir <folder>` | An installed OXT-Beyond, for example `-InstallDir "C:\Program Files\OXT-Beyond"`. |
| `-Exe <file name>` | An engine with another file name. |
| `-LogFile <file>` | Also writes the engine's output to a file. |

The smoke test does not open the IDE's windows; to check those, start
the IDE normally.

On Linux and macOS (and on Windows too) the same test runs through
[`tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py`](tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py) with
Python 3:

```sh
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py smoke --bin linux-x86_64-bin
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py smoke --install <staged OXT-Beyond-<ver> folder>
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py smoke --package OXT-Beyond-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
```

It passes what differs between platforms to the script (the processor,
the externals' suffix `.dll`/`.so`/`.bundle`, and the code folders the
IDE maps for LCB libraries) and takes the extension libraries'
dependencies from
[`tools/ci/check_native_deps.py`](tools/ci/check_native_deps.py), which
reads ELF, Mach-O and PE files itself (no readelf, otool or dumpbin): a
library that needs something that is neither a system library nor next
to it (on Linux: next to it with a run path of `$ORIGIN` itself, not
`$ORIGIN/lib`; on macOS: `@loader_path`, and a `.bundle` or `.framework`
folder is checked through its Mach-O) fails. `--package` extracts to a neutral temporary folder,
keeping modes and symbolic links; an installed layout in a folder named
`_build` or `*-bin` is refused, because the engine would run the IDE of
the checkout (repository mode). No X display is needed: `-ui` starts no
user interface.

### Documentation

LiveCode's Dictionary, the guides and Tom Perry's text dictionary
(*Preferences > Dictionary*) are generated from their sources, the only
copies Git keeps: the `.lcdoc` files of `docs/dictionary` and
`docs/glossary`, the documentation comments of the LiveCode Builder
modules in `libscript/src` and `engine/src`, the guides in `docs/guides`
and `ide/Documentation/guides`, and the documentation of the extensions
that OXT-Beyond installs and of the IDE library. For the
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) that documentation is
the doc comments of their sources at the pinned commits, which the
script fetches (the sources only, no native library) into the work
folder; LiveCode's Dictionary reads the same
comments from the installed sources when the IDE loads the extensions. A
member whose source has no doc comments simply has no entries.
[`tools/ci/build_docs.sh`](tools/ci/build_docs.sh) generates them into
`ide/Documentation/html_viewer/resources/data`, which Git ignores and
where `package.py` takes them from; packaging stops when they are
missing. Every CI build runs it (the Docs job, see
[Continuous integration](#9-continuous-integration)).

The script runs on Linux x86-64, and so in WSL on Windows. Install what
it needs once (in WSL with Ubuntu):

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl xz-utils zip python3 libglib2.0-0 libfontconfig1 libfreetype6
```

and run it from the checkout before you package, with a work folder on
the Linux side:

```bat
wsl bash tools/ci/build_docs.sh /tmp/oxt-docs
```

It downloads the Linux x86-64 engine of an OXT-Beyond release (about
110 MB; the version and its SHA-256 are at the top of the script),
keeps it in the work folder for the next run, and writes the
documentation in a minute or so. On Linux or macOS it can use
your own build instead, named as a second argument: a Linux build's
`linux-<arch>-bin`, or a macOS build's `_build/mac/Release` (not tried
yet). The engine's `modules/lci` decides which LiveCode Builder modules
are documented, so the docs of a new module of `libscript/src` or
`engine/src` need a newer pinned engine.

### Package

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\package-windows.ps1
```

[`tools/ci/package-windows.ps1`](tools/ci/package-windows.ps1) needs
Python 3 (section 2.6) and the [documentation](#documentation). It runs
[`tools/oxt/package.py`](tools/oxt/package.py), which writes the
*installed layout*, the program folder that the portable zip contains
and the installer installs, to `dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>\`. Then it
writes to `dist\` (`<ver>` is the content of `ide/.version`, for example
`0.0.1`):

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-portable.zip` | The staged program folder, under one top folder `OXT-Beyond-<ver>\`. |
| `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-binaries.zip` | `win-x86_64-bin` without `.pdb` files, plus `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`. Extracting it into the root of a source checkout gives the same layout as a build. |
| `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-symbols.zip` | The `.pdb` debug symbols, under `win-x86_64-bin\`. |
| `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-xtalk-sources.zip` | Only with `-XtalkSourcesZip` (CI sets it for release builds): every file the [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) pin, as packaging took them, with the manifest. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Checksums of the zips. [`build-installer.ps1`](#installer) rewrites it when it adds the installer. |

Options: `-BuildNumber <n>`, `-AssetsCache <folder>`,
`-NoExternalAssets`, `-NoXtalkExtensions`, `-XtalkCache <folder>`,
`-XtalkSourcesZip`, `-VcRedist <folder>` (see
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions)), `-OutDir <folder>` (default `dist`),
`-StageParent <folder>` (default `<OutDir>\stage`), `-BinDir <folder>`,
`-Python <path>` and `-CompressionLevel Optimal|Fastest|NoCompression`.
Existing files of the same names are replaced; other files in `dist`
are left alone.

`package.py` puts the staged folder together from:

- **the IDE**, assembled by `tools/oxt/layout.py` from `ide/Toolset`,
  `ide/Plugins`, `ide/Resources`, `ide/Documentation` (with the
  [documentation](#documentation) generated there), `ide/Extensions`,
  the files at the root of `ide/` (`about.dat`, `.version`, the licence
  texts and so on) and the eleven `ide-support` libraries, with LF line
  endings in text files whatever Git's `core.autocrlf` is;
- **the build output**, at the paths that
  [`Installer/package.txt`](Installer/package.txt) gives them on Windows
  x86-64: `OXT-Beyond.exe` (the development engine
  `LiveCode-Community.exe`, renamed), `revsecurity.dll` and
  `revpdfprinter.dll` at the root; `Externals\` (with `Externals.txt`),
  `Externals\Database Drivers\` (with `Database Drivers.txt`) and
  `Externals\CEF\`; `Toolchain\` with `lc-compile`, `lc-run`,
  `lc-compile-ffi-java` and the modules; `Runtime\Windows\x86-64\` with
  the standalone engine, its externals, support files and manifest
  templates; and `Extensions\` with the build's `packaged_extensions`
  and the extensions in `ide/Extensions`;
- **generated files**: `edition.txt` ("community"), `.buildnumber`, and
  two empty dictionary folders
  (`Documentation\html_viewer\resources\data\api\exports\{builder,datagrid}\plugins`)
  that Git cannot store;
- **the licence files** `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md` and
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, at the root;
- **the external assets**, see [below](#external-assets);
- **the xTalk Suite extensions** in `Extensions\`, fetched from their
  repositories at pinned commits and built with this build's
  `lc-compile`, see [below](#xtalk-suite-extensions);
- **the web runtime** in `Runtime\Emscripten\js\`, from which the IDE
  makes HTML5 standalones: the folder that `tools/ci/build-web.sh`
  writes (see [Building the web engine](#14-building-the-web-engine)),
  named by the environment variable `OXT_WEB_RUNTIME`. Without it the
  package has no web runtime, and the IDE offers no HTML5 standalones.

Some build outputs are deliberately not installed: the `.pdb` files,
LiveCode's own installer engine (`installer.exe`), the server engine and
its externals, and the `canvas` and `ini` library extensions, which
`Installer/package.txt` does not list.

The build number written into the packaged `.buildnumber` is
`-BuildNumber` (`--build-number` for `package.py`), else the environment
variable `OXT_BUILD_NUMBER`, else the current UTC time as
`YYYYMMDDHHMM`. `ide/.buildnumber` in the repository is only a
placeholder (`0`).

You can also run `package.py` directly:

```bat
python tools\oxt\package.py --repo . --bin win-x86_64-bin --out dist\stage
```

It takes `--build-number N`, `--assets-cache DIR`,
`--no-external-assets`, `--no-xtalk-extensions`, `--vc-redist DIR`,
`--xtalk-cache DIR`, `--offline` (use cached assets and extension files
only), `--eol lf|crlf|keep`, `--web-runtime DIR` (instead of
`OXT_WEB_RUNTIME`), `--summary-json FILE` and the comparison options
below.

**Comparing with OpenXTalk Lite 1.15.** The staged layout is meant to
contain every file of OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 that is not part of the IDE,
at the same path, apart from intended differences. To check:

```bat
python tools\oxt\package.py --repo . --bin win-x86_64-bin --out %TEMP%\oxtb-stage --compare "C:\path\to\OpenXTalk Lite" --report compare.tsv
```

`--compare` takes the extracted `openxtalk-lite-1.15-win-noinstaller.7z`
folder, or a TSV path list written by `layout.py classify`. It fails if
a file of 1.15 that is not part of the IDE is missing without a reason,
if a staged file that is not part of the IDE is not in 1.15 and is not
an intended addition, or if a file from an external asset is not
byte-identical to 1.15's (but see the runtime folders below). IDE
changes since 1.15 are listed but are not errors. The intended
differences are:

- `OpenXTalk-Lite.exe` is staged as `OXT-Beyond.exe`;
- `Ext\` (the mergExt externals) is not included (see
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#files-openxtalk-lite-shipped-that-oxt-beyond-does-not));
- ten `.lci` files in `Toolchain\modules\lci` are missing: interfaces of
  LiveCode commercial-edition modules that this repository does not
  have, and `com.livecode.commercial.license.lci`, which this build does
  not write;
- files `layout.py` classes "excluded" (Apple's Human Interface
  Guidelines PDF, `animationEngine6.zip`) or "junk"
  (`OpenXTalk Lite.lnk`, `test.db`, an empty
  `Toolset\palettes\dictionary\api.sqlite`, the unused
  `Toolset\palettes\standalone settings\mac-arm-deploy.oxtstack`) are not
  staged;
- the licence files, the runtimes asset's `PROVENANCE-*.md` and the
  xTalk Suite extensions (with `Extensions\XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt`) are
  added;
- with a runtimes asset made from this repository's builds (any but
  `oxt-runtimes-1.15`), the runtime folders it replaces
  (`Runtime\Windows\x86-32`, `Runtime\Linux` and the time zone library's
  code and data) may differ from 1.15's, lack the shared libraries that
  1.15's Linux runtimes bundled in `lib\`, or have new files.
  `Runtime\Android`, carried over unchanged, is still compared byte for
  byte;
- with a web runtime, `Runtime\Emscripten\js` is this repository's web
  engine: files that the reference has there and it lacks are intended
  missing, and the files it adds are intended additions.

Build outputs are staged as this repository builds them, so some of
them differ from Tom Perry's binaries in 1.15 even where the paths
match; the report marks them "rebuilt".

### Linux package

The Linux x86-64 package is made on Linux (or in WSL, under a Linux path
such as `/tmp`, never `/mnt/c`: the tree needs Unix modes and links)
from the two tarballs the Linux workflow uploads,
`OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64-bin.tar.xz` and
`OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64-symbols.tar.xz` (see
[tools/oxt/README.md](tools/oxt/README.md) for the layout), once the
[documentation](#documentation) is generated:

```sh
python3 tools/oxt/package.py --platform linux-x86_64 \
    --bin-tar OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64-bin.tar.xz --out /tmp/stage --summary-json /tmp/stage.json
python3 tools/oxt/package_dist.py --summary /tmp/stage.json \
    --bin-tar OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64-bin.tar.xz \
    --symbols-tar OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64-symbols.tar.xz --out dist
```

This writes `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` (the program folder
`OXT-Beyond-<ver>`), `-binaries.tar.xz` (`linux-x86_64-bin` without the
`.dbg` files, plus the licence files), `-symbols.tar.xz` (the `.dbg`
files) and `SHA256SUMS`. Besides the engine (`OXT-Beyond`) and the IDE,
the folder has the launcher `oxt-beyond`, `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`
and `linux/` (desktop entry, MIME types, icons and the library list the
launcher checks), from
[`Installer/linux`](Installer/linux). Test it extracted to a folder
whose path has no `_build` or `*-bin` in it:

```sh
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py smoke --package dist/OXT-Beyond-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py compile --install <folder>/OXT-Beyond-<ver> --engine <folder>/OXT-Beyond-<ver>/oxt-beyond
python3 tools/ci/check_linux_libraries.py --root <folder>/OXT-Beyond-<ver> --repo .
python3 tools/ci/standalone_check.py --install <folder>/OXT-Beyond-<ver> --platform linux-x86_64
python3 tools/ci/test_linux_package.py --root <folder>/OXT-Beyond-<ver>
```

`check_linux_libraries.py` runs `ldd` over every x86-64 ELF file and
checks that `Installer/linux/libraries.txt` names every system library
the package needs; run it where that list's packages are installed.
`test_linux_package.py` tests the launcher with a stand-in engine and
runs `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` in scratch home folders (it never
touches your own). The Linux workflow's "Package linux-x86_64" job does
all of this on `ubuntu-24.04` (see [Continuous integration](#9-continuous-integration)).

### macOS app

The universal macOS app is made on a Mac (the job "Package
mac-universal" uses `macos-15`) from the two builds the macOS workflow
uploads, `OXT-Beyond-mac-arm64-bin.tar.xz` and
`OXT-Beyond-mac-x86_64-bin.tar.xz`, each with its `-symbols.tar.xz`
extracted over it (all four unpack as `Release/`, so each architecture
goes into a folder of its own). Keep every path free of folders named
`_build` or `*-bin`, which put the engine into repository mode. With the
[documentation](#documentation) generated, the steps, as the job runs them (see
[tools/oxt/README.md](tools/oxt/README.md#universal-build-signing-and-disk-image-macos)):

```sh
python3 tools/ci/merge_universal.py --arm64 A/Release --x86_64 X/Release --out U/Release --report merge-report.tsv
python3 tools/ci/sign_mac_app.py U/Release
python3 tools/oxt/package.py --platform mac-universal --bin U/Release --out /tmp/stage --summary-json /tmp/stage.json
python3 tools/ci/sign_mac_app.py /tmp/stage/OXT-Beyond-<ver>/OXT-Beyond.app
python3 tools/ci/merge_universal.py --check /tmp/stage/OXT-Beyond-<ver>/OXT-Beyond.app
python3 tools/oxt/package_dist.py --summary /tmp/stage.json --bin U/Release --out dist --dmg
```

This joins the two builds with `lipo`, signs the result ad hoc, stages
`OXT-Beyond.app` (the engine in `Contents/MacOS`, everything else in
`Contents/Tools`), signs the app from the inside out, checks that every
Mach-O file of macOS code in it holds arm64 and x86_64, and writes
`OXT-Beyond-<ver>-mac-universal.dmg`, `-mac-universal.zip`,
`-mac-universal-binaries.tar.xz`, `-mac-universal-symbols.zip` and
`SHA256SUMS`, and checks that the zip holds the same signed app. The
test jobs download only the disk image (the artifact
`OXT-Beyond-mac-universal-dmg`), install the app from it into a
neutral folder on an Apple Silicon and an Intel runner and run:

```sh
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 <folder>/OXT-Beyond.app
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py smoke --install <folder> --platform mac-universal
python3 tools/ci/check_native_deps.py --root <folder>/OXT-Beyond.app/Contents/Tools --platform mac --max-macos 15.0
python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py compile --install <folder> --platform mac-universal
python3 tools/ci/standalone_check.py --install <folder> --platform mac-universal
```

`standalone_check.py` builds a Mac standalone from the packaged runtime
with the engine's deploy command, signs it as the IDE does and runs it
(see [Standalone check](#standalone-check)).

### External assets

External assets are files that the packages include but that this
repository neither builds nor keeps in Git, such as the standalone
runtimes for other platforms. They are listed in
[`tools/oxt/external-assets.json`](tools/oxt/external-assets.json). Each
asset is one zip archive with a fixed URL, size and SHA-256:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | A unique name, used in messages and reports. |
| `url` | HTTPS URL of the archive. |
| `sha256`, `size` | SHA-256 (lowercase hex) and size in bytes of the archive. |
| `kind` | `zip` (the only kind so far). |
| `strip` | Number of leading path components removed from every member of the archive. |
| `dest` | Folder, relative to the installed root, that the remaining paths go into (`""` for the root). |
| `rename` | Optional: members that go somewhere else, as `{"<path after strip>": "<path relative to dest>"}`. |
| `description`, `licence`, `source` | Text for people and reports. |

Today there is one asset, `oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2`: the Windows (x86-64
and x86) and Linux (x86-64 and x86) runtimes and the time zone library's
code for them and its zoneinfo data, made from this repository's CI
builds, with the Android runtime and its time zone library code carried
over unchanged from the earlier asset `oxt-runtimes-1.15` (OpenXTalk
Lite 1.15's files). Its `PROVENANCE.md` (installed as
`PROVENANCE-oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.md`) names the commit and the CI
runs and lists every file; the 1.15 asset's provenance comes with it as
`PROVENANCE-oxt-runtimes-1.15.md`. It is published as the file
`oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.zip` of this repository's release
`runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2`. Each package leaves out the part its own build
makes (the entry's `exclude`). The manifest names that release in this
repository, so a fork downloads it from here too. To package
without the external assets, for example while a new asset is not
published yet, use `-NoExternalAssets` (in CI, the `no_external_assets`
input or the `OXT_NO_EXTERNAL_ASSETS` variable; see
[Continuous integration](#9-continuous-integration)).

**Download cache.** The archives are downloaded into the folder given
with `-AssetsCache` (`--assets-cache`), else the environment variable
`OXT_ASSETS_CACHE`, else `prebuilt\fetched-assets` in the repository
(ignored by Git). An archive in the cache is used when its size and
SHA-256 match the manifest; otherwise it is downloaded again over HTTPS
(redirects followed, transient errors retried) to a temporary name and
moved into place once it has been verified. A download whose size or
SHA-256 does not match the manifest is an error and is not retried.
[`tools/oxt/fetch_assets.py`](tools/oxt/fetch_assets.py) does the same
without packaging:

```bat
python tools\oxt\fetch_assets.py --list
python tools\oxt\fetch_assets.py
```

It also takes `--assets-cache DIR`, `--offline` and `--id ID`. To
package on a computer without internet access, copy the archive (with
its file name from the URL) into the cache folder; with `--offline`,
`package.py` makes sure nothing is downloaded.
`-NoExternalAssets` (`--no-external-assets`) leaves the assets out
altogether; the IDE then offers no standalone targets for other
platforms.

**Making the runtimes asset.** Start the "Runtimes asset" workflow
([`.github/workflows/runtimes.yml`](.github/workflows/runtimes.yml)) by
hand with a label (the version whose packages will take the asset, for
example `0.2.1-rc.3`) and the ids of a "Build (Windows)" and a "Build
(Linux)" run of the same commit whose 32-bit and 64-bit builds passed.
It makes the archive with
[`tools/oxt/make_runtimes_asset.py --builds`](tools/oxt/README.md#the-runtimes-asset),
shows the manifest entry in its summary and, with `publish` and a
commit on `main`, publishes the pre-release `runtimes-<label>`. Then pin
that entry in `tools/oxt/external-assets.json` in a pull request. Make
a new asset whenever the engine or the externals change, so that the
other platforms' runtimes in the packages stay those of the release.

`oxt-runtimes-1.15` was made differently, from an extracted OpenXTalk
Lite release, taking only files that `layout.py` classes "external" (not
`Ext\`):

```bat
python tools\oxt\make_runtimes_asset.py "C:\path\to\OpenXTalk Lite" --out C:\tmp\oxt-asset --source-archive openxtalk-lite-1.15-win-noinstaller.7z --update-manifest
```

It writes `oxt-runtimes-<version>.zip` and a copy of its `PROVENANCE.md`
to the `--out` folder. With `--stock-setup <file>` (the `.setup.exe` of
LiveCode Community 9.6.3 for Windows) `PROVENANCE.md` also says which
files are identical to LiveCode's. The zip is reproducible (sorted
entries, file dates from the files), so the same folder and options
give the same SHA-256. `--update-manifest` writes the size and SHA-256
into `tools/oxt/external-assets.json`; commit that change.

**Publishing an asset** made by hand is a manual step for a maintainer
(the runtimes workflow does the same itself). Create a release with a
tag that does not start with `v` and attach the files; `PROVENANCE.md` is
too long for release notes, so attach it as a file:

```bat
gh release create runtimes-1.15 C:\tmp\oxt-asset\oxt-runtimes-1.15.zip C:\tmp\oxt-asset\PROVENANCE.md --prerelease --title "Standalone runtimes from OpenXTalk Lite 1.15" --notes "Prebuilt files used by tools/oxt/package.py. See PROVENANCE.md (also inside the zip)."
```

`--prerelease` keeps the release from becoming the repository's latest
release, because GitHub never treats a pre-release as the latest
release. OXT-Beyond's update check reads the latest release first; it
skips releases whose tag is not a version, but people browsing the
Releases page would see an asset release marked latest. Never replace
the file of a published asset: the manifest pins its SHA-256, and
packages made earlier must stay reproducible. To change
an asset, publish it under a new tag and add or update the manifest
entry.

**Adding an asset**: add an entry with the URL of the release archive,
its size and SHA-256, `strip` and `dest`, and its description, licence
and source; add the component to
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md); and check the staged
result. Extensions from the xTalk Suite are not assets; they have their
own manifest, described next.

### xTalk Suite extensions

OXT-Beyond ships the extensions of the
[xTalk Suite](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/xtalk-suite) built
in (the [README](README.md#xtalk-suite-extensions) lists them): six LiveCode
Builder libraries with native code and nine LiveCode Script libraries.
They are neither kept in this repository nor copied into it.
[`tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json`](tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json)
pins each member repository (`SethMorrowSoftware/<repository>`) at a
commit and lists the exact files taken from it, each with the SHA-256
and size of its Git blob, and
[`tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py`](tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py) fetches
and builds them. `package.py` runs it with the build it packages, so a
package always has the pinned versions, compiled by its own
`lc-compile`.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name`, `repository`, `commit` | The member, its `owner/repository` on GitHub and the full commit SHA-1. |
| `version`, `version_from` | The member's version, and where `pin` reads it: a file and a regular expression (the `.lcb` metadata, or a version constant of a script library). |
| `files` | Every file taken: its `path` in the repository, its `role` (`source`; `library` for the native libraries in `src/code/<platform-id>/`, all five platform ids; `code-manifest` for the member's `MANIFEST.sha256`; `licence`), the `sha256` and `size` of its Git blob and, for Windows libraries, `imports`, the DLLs it imports. A licence file may have a `name` to use in `licenses/`, `"extract": "leading-comment"` (only the comment at the top of the file is shipped: the RHash notice in SodiumXT's `sha3.c`, the trezor-crypto notices in CoinXT's `address.c` and `hasher.c`), or a `repository` and `commit` of its own (OpenSSL's licence text, for the two members that link OpenSSL). |
| `extensions` | What is made from the files: `kind` (`lcb` or `lcs`), `id`, `folder` in `Extensions\`, the `main` file, `probe` and `expect` (an expression and a regular expression its value must match, for the smoke test) and, for script libraries, `stack`, `title`, `author` and `requires`. |
| `vc_runtime` (top level) | The Visual C++ runtime DLLs bundled with the libraries that need them (see below): `redist`, the redistributable folder they were pinned from, `file_version`, the DLLs' file version, and `files`, the `sha256` and `size` of each DLL per Windows platform id. |

Line endings matter: the SHA-256 values are those of the files as Git
stores them (LF), which is what `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves. A
clone with `core.autocrlf=true` has other bytes in its working copy.

**What is built.** For each LCB library, `Extensions\<id>\` with the
`.lcb` source, `module.lcm` and `manifest.xml` from `lc-compile`,
`code\<platform-id>\<library>` for Windows x86-64 and x86, Linux x86-64
and x86 and macOS (the IDE maps the one for its platform into
`revLibraryMapping`, and the standalone builder copies the one for the
target into a standalone), and `licenses\`. `lc-compile` runs in that
folder with relative paths, because `module.lcm` embeds the source path
as given; writes the module interface into a temporary folder
(`--interface`), never into `modules\lci` (which the build checks is
unchanged); and runs without `-Werror`, because Box2Dxt's module id
`org.openxtalk.box2dxt` has a digit in a namespace component, which is a
warning. For each script library, `Extensions\<stack>\` with
`<stack>.livecodescript`, `manifest.xml` and `licenses\`. The script is
the pinned file with a `script "<stack>"` first line where it has none
(OnionXT's two files and the Box2Dxt Kit, whose line numbers are then
one more than in their repositories) and an `extensionInitialize` /
`extensionFinalize` pair appended at the end: the IDE loads a script
library by sending it `extensionInitialize`, and without that handler it
would sit in memory without being in the message path. The stack name,
the file name and the folder are the same and contain no dots, because
the IDE loads a script library under the part of its file name before
the first dot. The stack names are the ones the members document, not
reverse-DNS ids such as `org.openxtalk.library.coinxt`: a script
library's extension id is its stack name, a standalone loads it under
that name, and the members' code and documentation use
`start using stack "coinxt"` and so on. The cost is that a user's own
copy of one of these files, opened by its path while the built-in copy
is loaded, clashes with it: the engine keeps one stack per name and
sends `reloadStack`, and the IDE's handler then asks what to do. For an
`.lce` installed during the session, the built-in stack stays in memory
after it is unloaded, so the user's copy takes over only after a
restart. The README tells users this. `manifest.xml` is written from
the JSON; `requires` makes the IDE load a script library after the
libraries it needs.
`Extensions\XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt` lists every extension with its
repository and commit. The same pins (including `vc_runtime`) and
`lc-compile` give the same files.

**The Visual C++ runtime.** `enetxt.dll` imports `MSVCP140.dll`,
`VCRUNTIME140.dll` and (x86-64) `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`, and
`box2dxt.dll` imports `VCRUNTIME140.dll`: these two members build with
the dynamic runtime. OXT-Beyond's engine links the runtime statically
and does not install it, and a PC without the Visual C++ Redistributable
does not have these DLLs. So the build copies every DLL that a library
in `code\x86_64-win32` or `code\x86-win32` imports and that is neither a
Windows system DLL nor already in that folder from Visual Studio's
redistributable folder (`VC\Redist\MSVC\<version>`, the one with
`x64\Microsoft.VC14x.CRT` and `x86\Microsoft.VC14x.CRT`) into the
folder, next to the library. The engine loads extension libraries with
`LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH`, so Windows looks for their DLLs there
first, and the standalone builder copies them into a standalone's
`Externals` folder with the library. They are Microsoft's Distributable
Code, so the build also writes `licenses\Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt`
into those extensions: the DLLs, the Microsoft licence terms they are
under (with links) and what those terms ask of anyone who distributes
them further, for example in a standalone (see
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#microsoft-components)).
The build also checks that the
copies export every function the library imports from them. That
catches a redistributable that lacks a function, not every older one.
It warns when a copy's file version is older than the MSVC linker that
built the library, because Microsoft supports only a runtime at least as
new as the newest toolset used. That is the case now: `enetxt.dll` and
`box2dxt.dll` are linked with MSVC 14.51, while Visual Studio 2022 (the
CI image) ships runtime 14.44. Microsoft does not support that
combination, although both libraries load and pass the smoke test with
it. `XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt` records each copy with its SHA-256 and file
version, and the redistributable folder it came from.

The runtime DLLs are pinned like everything else: `vc_runtime` in
`xtalk-extensions.json` lists the SHA-256 and size of each DLL per
platform (now Visual Studio 2022 17.14's redistributable folder
`14.44.35112`, file version 14.44.35211.0, which the windows-2022 CI
image has), and packaging verifies every copy against it. A copy from
another redistributable stops the build with both hashes and the pinned
file version; otherwise the same commit would package different DLLs on
another machine, or after the CI image moves to a newer Visual Studio.
`--allow-unpinned-vc-runtime` (`-AllowUnpinnedVcRuntime` for
`package-windows.ps1`) only warns instead, and the stamp then says the
runtime is not the pinned one; it is for trying out another
redistributable, never for a release (CI does not set it). To move to
another redistributable, pin it and commit the result:

```bat
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py pin-vc-runtime --vc-redist "%VCToolsRedistDir%."
```

It hashes, for every Windows platform id of the manifest, the DLLs the
libraries' recorded `imports` need from that folder (and what those DLLs
import in turn), and rewrites `redist`, `file_version` and `files`,
keeping the block's comment, which you update if it names the old
folder. So a new runner image with a newer Visual Studio takes one
command and a commit.

`package-windows.ps1` takes the folder from `-VcRedist` as given.
Otherwise it collects `VCToolsRedistDir` (set in a Visual Studio
developer prompt) and the redistributable folders of every Visual Studio
with the C++ tools that `vswhere` finds (newest first, each one's
default folder first) and takes the first that has the pinned DLLs, so
that a machine with several Visual Studio installs packages the pinned
runtime rather than the newest; if none has them, the first folder, and
packaging then stops with the mismatch. For `package.py` and
`xtalk_extensions.py` the folder is `--vc-redist`. Without it, packaging
warns and lists the libraries that cannot load on a PC without the
redistributable, and the checks below fail.

**Checks.** [`tools/ci/check-extension-imports.ps1`](tools/ci/check-extension-imports.ps1)
`-Root <installed layout>` reads the import tables of every DLL in
`Extensions\*\code\*-win32` and fails if one imports a DLL that is
neither a Windows system DLL (KERNEL32, USER32, ADVAPI32, WS2_32, WINMM,
CRYPT32, bcrypt, IPHLPAPI, MSWSOCK, msvcrt, api-ms-win-crt-*) nor next to
it; loading the libraries on a computer that has Visual Studio proves
nothing. The [smoke test](#smoke-test) maps each LCB library's
`code\x86_64-win32` files in `revLibraryMapping` as the IDE does, loads
its `module.lcm`, checks the result and evaluates its probe
(`sxVersion()`, `btLastError()`, `enLibraryVersion()`,
`dcLibraryVersion()`, `b2Version()` = 4, `cxKeccak256Len()` = 32); starts
each script library with `start using` after the ones it requires,
evaluates its probe (`cxHexEncode(numToByte(0))` = `00`, `b2kVersion()`
= 4, `oxVersion()`, `nxVersion()`, `nxrVersion()` and so on) and checks
that `extensionInitialize` and `extensionFinalize` put it into the back
scripts and take it out; and fails for a library whose imports the check
above would reject. The [IDE compile check](#ide-compile-check)
compiles the script libraries with the rest of `Extensions`.

**Cache and offline use.** The files are downloaded from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repository>/<commit>/<path>` into
the folder given with `--xtalk-cache`, else `OXT_XTALK_CACHE`, else the
`xtalk` folder of the asset cache (`prebuilt\fetched-assets\xtalk` by
default), as `<repository>\<commit>\<path>`. A cached file is used when
its size and SHA-256 match the manifest and deleted when they do not;
downloads go through `fetch_assets.py` (HTTPS only, transient errors
retried, verified before they are moved into place). The native
libraries are also checked against the member's `MANIFEST.sha256`.
`--offline` never downloads; with a filled cache, packaging works without
internet access. CI caches the folder, keyed on the manifest.

**Keeping the pinned files with a release.** The pins are commits of the
members' branches, fetched live, so rebuilding an old release depends on
the member repositories keeping those commits (a rewritten history, or a
renamed or private repository, would break it). Release builds
therefore also publish `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-xtalk-sources.zip` with the
release, listed in its `SHA256SUMS` (the Windows job writes it, once for
all platforms, since every platform takes the same pinned files): every pinned file, in the cache layout
`<repository>\<commit>\<path>`, with a copy of `xtalk-extensions.json`.
`xtalk_extensions.py export` writes it (sorted entries and fixed dates,
so the same pins give the same zip), and `package-windows.ps1
-XtalkSourcesZip` runs that. To rebuild an old tag, extract that
release's zip into an empty folder and use the folder as the cache:
`-XtalkCache <folder>` for `package-windows.ps1`, `--xtalk-cache <folder>
--offline` for `package.py`, `--cache <folder> --offline` for
`xtalk_extensions.py`. The files are still checked against the manifest.
As with external assets, never delete or replace this file of a
published release.

```bat
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py list
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py fetch
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py build --bin win-x86_64-bin --out %TEMP%\xtalk --vc-redist "%VCToolsRedistDir%."
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py export --out %TEMP%\xtalk-sources.zip
```

`VCToolsRedistDir` ends in a backslash, and cmd would pass `\"` on as a
literal quote (the rest of the line then ends up in the same argument).
The trailing `.` prevents that, and the path still resolves to the same
folder.

`fetch` also takes `--cache DIR`, `--offline`, `--member NAME` and
`--platforms x86_64-win32,x86-win32`; `build` takes `--cache`,
`--offline`, `--platforms` and `--summary-json FILE`, and replaces only
the folders it made before; `export` takes `--cache` and `--offline`.

**Taking newer versions.** The pins change only when a maintainer runs
`pin` and commits the result:

```bat
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py pin
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py pin --member CoinXT
python tools\oxt\xtalk_extensions.py pin --member Box2Dxt --ref <branch, tag or commit of the default branch>
```

`pin` resolves the commit (the head of the default branch unless
`--ref` is given; with `git ls-remote`, else the GitHub API). A commit
given with `--ref` must be on the member's default branch, which `pin`
checks with one call of the GitHub compare API. For a SHA-1 this is not
negotiable: `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves the commits of every fork
and unmerged pull request under the member's name, and a SHA-1 alone
does not show whose commit it is. A branch or tag named with `--ref`
whose commit is not on the default branch is refused as well, because
the packages fetch the pinned files live and such a commit disappears
when its branch is deleted; `--allow-off-branch` pins it anyway. Then
`pin` downloads every listed file at that commit, and rewrites the
manifest with the commit, the version, each file's SHA-256 and size and
the Windows libraries' imports, keeping its order and layout. It stops if a
library's hash differs from the member's `MANIFEST.sha256`, if that file
lists a library the manifest does not take (a new platform, for
example: add it to `files`), or if an LCB source declares another module
id or a script library another stack name than its extension entry.
Then review the diff (a changed `imports` list means a library needs
another DLL; if it is a Visual C++ runtime DLL, also run
`pin-vc-runtime`, or packaging stops at the unpinned copy), package and
run the smoke test, update
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#xtalk-suite-extensions)
if the components or licences changed, and commit. A new file or
extension is added to the manifest by hand, then `pin` fills in its
hashes.

**Leaving them out.** `-NoXtalkExtensions` (or the environment variable
`NO_XTALK_EXTENSIONS=1`) for `package-windows.ps1`,
`--no-xtalk-extensions` for `package.py`, and in CI the workflow input
`no_xtalk_extensions` or the repository variable
`OXT_NO_XTALK_EXTENSIONS=1` (release builds always include them).

### IDE compile check

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\ide-compile-check.ps1 -Root dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>
```

[`tools/ci/ide-compile-check.ps1`](tools/ci/ide-compile-check.ps1) runs
[`tools/ci/ide-compile-check.livecodescript`](tools/ci/ide-compile-check.livecodescript)
with the engine of that layout, without a user interface. It compiles
every script-only stack (`*.livecodescript`, `*.oxtscript`) under
`Toolset`, `Plugins` and `Extensions`, and every object script (stacks,
cards, groups and controls) of the binary stacks (`*.livecode`, `*.rev`,
`*.oxtstack`) under `Toolset` and `Plugins`; the script-only stacks
include the script libraries of the
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions). Stacks are loaded
with messages locked; they are never opened or saved. Each error is one
line:

```text
<file> | <object> | line <n> | <message>
```

Errors listed in
[`tools/ci/ide-compile-baseline.txt`](tools/ci/ide-compile-baseline.txt)
are known, pre-existing errors. The check fails (exit code 1) when there
is an error that is not in the baseline, or when the engine does not
finish; baseline entries that no longer occur are reported as warnings.
Today the baseline lists no errors. Its last entry was a button script
in the macOS ARM standalone builder (`mac-arm-deploy.oxtstack`), which
called `_internal build MacARM`, a command this engine does not have;
nothing opened that stack, so it was removed.

Options: `-Root` (default: the single `OXT-Beyond-*` folder in
`dist\stage`), `-Engine` (default: the layout's `OXT-Beyond.exe`, or
`win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe` for a layout without an engine),
`-LogFile`, `-TimeoutSeconds`. To rewrite the baseline from the current
errors, add `-UpdateBaseline` (and `-BaselineSource "<description>"`);
review the result before committing it.

On Linux and macOS, `tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py compile` does the
same with the same baseline (`--install <layout>`, `--package <file>`,
`--root <folder> --engine <file>`, `--update-baseline`). With
`--repo-layout --bin <build output>` it checks the source checkout before
anything is packaged: the Toolset, Plugins and Extensions that
`tools/oxt/layout.py` assembles from `ide/` and `ide-support/`, plus the
build's packaged extensions, are written to a temporary folder with their
installed paths (so the error records match the baseline's) and checked
with the build's development engine. The Linux and macOS workflows run
it after every build.

A file that crashes the engine is recorded as
`<file> | (file) | line 0 | the engine crashed while checking it`, and the
rest is checked in a second run. Errors that occur on one platform only
are listed in `tools/ci/ide-compile-baseline-<windows|linux|mac>.txt`
next to the shared baseline, which the Python check adds on that
platform (`--update-baseline` leaves them out of the shared file). The
Linux file has no entries at present: it listed
`Plugins/Quick Dictionary.livecode` while the Linux engine crashed on a
stack whose `textFont` is `(System)` without a user interface (the GTK
theme gives that font no family there; the engine now falls back to its
default family).

### Engine tests

```bat
python tools\ci\run_engine_tests.py --bin win-x86_64-bin
```

[`tools/ci/run_engine_tests.py`](tools/ci/run_engine_tests.py) (Python
3) runs the test suites that LiveCode Community keeps in
[`tests/`](tests) against a build output (`win-x86_64-bin`,
`linux-<arch>-bin`, or on macOS `_build/mac/Release`), without a user
interface:

- `lcs`: each `on Test...` handler of the LiveCode Script tests in
  `tests/lcs` (about 850), in its own run of the build's standalone
  engine with `-ui` (`tests/_testrunner.livecodescript invoke`) and a
  time limit (`--timeout`, 300 seconds). The LiveCode Builder modules of
  `tests/` are compiled into `_tests/_build` first.
- `lcb`: the LiveCode Builder tests of `tests/lcb` (the virtual machine,
  the standard library and compiled code): each `Test...` handler of each
  module, in its own run of `lc-run` with the test library. (LiveCode's
  `tests/_testrunner.lcb` does the same, but not on Windows.)
- `compiler`: the LiveCode Builder compiler tests of `tests/lcb/compiler`.
- `parser`: the LiveCode Script parser tests.

`--suite` runs some of them; `--filter` takes a regular expression that
the name `<suite>: <test>` must match, for example
`--filter "core/strings/sort"`. `--jobs N` runs the LiveCode Script tests
of N files at a time (the tests of one file one after the other); the
files that use fixed ports, the clipboard or programs they start
(`SERIAL_FILES` in the script) run one after the other. CI uses
`--jobs 4`: about 25 seconds on Linux, and a few minutes on macOS, where
one at a time took 12.

Failed tests are compared with
[`tools/ci/engine-tests-baseline.txt`](tools/ci/engine-tests-baseline.txt)
(failures on every platform), the platform's
`engine-tests-baseline-<windows|linux|mac>.txt` next to it, and
`engine-tests-baseline-<platform>-<arch>.txt` for failures on one
processor architecture (`x86_64`, `arm64` or `x86`; `--arch`, by default
the computer's). A failure in none of them fails the check (exit code 1), but
first the test is run once more (`--retries`), and one that passes then
is only reported as flaky.
Baseline entries whose tests passed are reported so that they can be
removed; an entry marked `? ` fails only sometimes and is not reported.
`--update-baseline` rewrites the platform's file. When a test crashes the
engine, it is run again under a debugger and the stack goes into the log:
on Windows with [`tools/ci/win_crashtrace.py`](tools/ci/win_crashtrace.py)
(Python and Windows' own `dbghelp.dll`, with the `.pdb` files next to the
binaries, or `--symbols <folder>`, for example an extracted symbols zip),
on Linux with `gdb` and on macOS with `lldb` when they are installed. The
log (`--log`, by default `_tests/engine-tests.log`) has the output of
every failed test.

A few tests act on the computer they run on: they start Notepad
(TextEdit on macOS) and then end every running copy of it, write a file
to the Desktop, or set the system clipboard. They run in CI (where `CI`
is `true`) and are skipped elsewhere unless you pass `--desktop-tests`.
On Windows the tests run with `the hideConsoleWindows` set, so the
commands they run open no console windows.

Every CI build runs the four suites after the IDE compile check: on
Windows (x86-64 and x86), Linux (x86-64, arm64 and x86) and macOS
(Apple Silicon and Intel). The job summary lists new failures, flaky
tests and baseline entries that passed. The 32-bit builds have
supplements of their own: `tools/ci/engine-tests-baseline-linux-x86.txt`
(dates before 1901, x87 floating point and the 32-bit `naturalfloat`) and
`tools/ci/engine-tests-baseline-windows-x86.txt` (the 32-bit
`naturalfloat`).

### Standalone check

[`tools/ci/standalone_check.py`](tools/ci/standalone_check.py) builds a
standalone the way the IDE's standalone builder does at its core: the
layout's engine runs `tools/ci/standalone-deploy.livecodescript`, which
saves a one-handler stack and attaches it to a copy of a runtime with
`_internal deploy` (the command `revStandaloneDeployWithParams` uses).
The standalone must be a file of the runtime's format and architecture;
where this computer can run it, it is run without a user interface and
must report the engine's version, its processor, its platform and the
environment `command line`. Before that, the runtime's folder is
checked: its engine, its Support files and every external, database
driver and (for the browser) CEF library that its lists name must be
there, built for that runtime's architecture.

```bat
python tools\ci\standalone_check.py --package dist\OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-portable.zip --platform win-x86_64
python tools\ci\standalone_check.py --package dist\OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-portable.zip --platform win-x86_64 --targets all
python tools\ci\standalone_check.py --engine win-x86-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe --runtime win-x86-bin\standalone-community.exe --platform win-x86
```

`--install <folder>` takes an installed layout instead of a package. By
default (`--targets own`) the layout's own runtime is used; `--targets
all` takes every runtime of the layout (Windows x86-64 and x86, Linux
x86-64 and x86, the Mac's universal one), building each standalone with
the layout's engine, since any engine deploys for every platform:
Windows runs both Windows standalones, Linux and macOS their own. Android
standalones need the Android SDK and are not checked. The CI jobs run
it with `--targets all` on every package (the Windows portable zip, the
Linux tar.xz and the macOS app on both Mac architectures), and on the
32-bit builds with `--engine` and `--runtime`.

### Browser and player check

[`tools/ci/media_check.py`](tools/ci/media_check.py) checks the browser
widget, revBrowser and the player in a standalone with a user interface.
It copies the layout's own standalone runtime to a folder of its own (with
its Externals and, on Windows and Linux, CEF and its helper processes, as
a built standalone has them), serves a test page on 127.0.0.1 and runs
[`tools/ci/media-check.livecodescript`](tools/ci/media-check.livecodescript)
in that engine: the page must load in the browser widget and in revBrowser
(revBrowserOpenCef; on macOS revBrowserOpen), its JavaScript must call a
handler of the script, and a WAV file and
[`tools/ci/media/oxt-check.mp4`](tools/ci/media/oxt-check.mp4) (H.264 and
AAC; with it an AVI with Motion JPEG and PCM, and a video-only MP4 and
AVI, which tell a format a player cannot open from a machine without a
sound device) must play, pause and send `playStopped` at their end. Each
part runs in an engine of its own. What a platform's player is known not
to play is reported as KNOWN without failing the check (`KNOWN` in the
script): on Windows, MP4, which DirectShow cannot open without a
third-party filter, and on a Windows machine without a sound device, the
WAV file.

```sh
python3 tools/ci/media_check.py --package dist/OXT-Beyond-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
python3 tools/ci/media_check.py --install <folder> --platform mac-universal
```

On Linux the player runs `/usr/bin/mplayer` (the `mplayer` package), the
engine runs under `xvfb-run` when there is no `DISPLAY`, and on a machine
without a sound card mplayer plays without sound (`ao=null` through
`MPLAYER_HOME`). There the check also clicks the controller the engine
draws below mplayer's video (play, pause, a click in the well of the AVI
file, whose frames are all key frames) and reads what it draws from
snapshots of the player; `--snapshots <folder>` keeps those snapshots and
the screen with the video (the Linux build puts them with its logs). The
CI runs it on every package after the standalone check, on macOS after the
IDE screenshots: there macOS then asks whether Python, which started it,
may find devices on the local network, and the question stays on the
screen. [`media-check.yml`](.github/workflows/media-check.yml) runs it on
the packages of a published release (by hand, for any tag), and on
macOS starts the release's IDE as well (`tools/ci/mac_ide_start.sh`).

### Browser window manager check (Linux)

[`tools/ci/browser_wm_check.py`](tools/ci/browser_wm_check.py) runs the
browser widget in a standalone of the Linux package on an Xvfb screen
under real window managers, xfwm4 and openbox in turn, with
[`tools/ci/browser-wm-check.livecodescript`](tools/ci/browser-wm-check.livecodescript),
and checks from outside the engine (xdotool, xwininfo and ImageMagick's
`import`) that the page is on the screen in a new stack, in that stack
closed and opened again and in a second stack, that typing goes to a
field of the stack after the page loaded and after a click into the
browser, and that the application gets no `suspend` while the keyboard is
in the browser. Up to 0.2.3 the browser's window could stay unmapped under
openbox and kept the keyboard under xfwm4 (pull request #57).

```sh
sudo apt-get install xvfb xfwm4 openbox xdotool x11-utils imagemagick
python3 tools/ci/browser_wm_check.py --install <folder> --shots <folder>
```

The Linux build runs it on its package after the browser and player check.

### Web standalone check

[`tools/ci/web_check.py`](tools/ci/web_check.py) makes an HTML5
standalone of a probe stack,
[`tools/ci/web-probe.livecodescript`](tools/ci/web-probe.livecodescript),
serves it on 127.0.0.1 and opens it in headless Chromium. The probe
checks waits, timers, `do ... as "JavaScript"`, files, URLs, the page's
dialogs, the standard folders, a download, sound, the player, the
browser widget, the externals that the web engine has, encryption,
speech and printing, and writes what it finds to the browser's console;
the check then clicks, types, taps and drags a finger in the stack,
drags and drops, types with a touch screen's keyboard, holds the mouse
down in a loop that asks for it, takes snapshots of the page and drags
out the rectangle of one, clicks and types under a modal dialog and into
it, calls the stack's handlers from the page, and looks at what it
draws. Every check must pass, and nothing may
reach the browser's error console. It
needs Python 3.8 or later and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/)
with its Chromium:

```sh
python3 -m pip install playwright==1.56.0
python3 -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
python3 tools/ci/web_check.py --install <folder> --platform linux-x86_64
python3 tools/ci/web_check.py --runtime <web runtime> --engine-cache <folder>
```

`--install <folder>` (or `--package <file>`) makes the standalone with
the layout's own IDE, as a user does: the IDE starts with
[`tools/ci/web-deploy.livecodescript`](tools/ci/web-deploy.livecodescript)
named on its command line (under `xvfb-run` on Linux without a
`DISPLAY`), which builds the probe stack with the IDE's web builder. `--bin
<folder>` does the same with a clone's IDE (repository mode), whose web
runtime is the clone's `emscripten-bin`. `--runtime <folder>` needs no
IDE: a development engine writes the standalone's startup data as the
web builder does, and the script puts the rest together; the engine is
`--engine <file>`, or the Linux x86-64 engine of the release that
`tools/ci/build_docs.sh` pins, downloaded into the `--engine-cache`
folder. `--built <folder>` opens a probe standalone that is already built,
and `--keep-serving` keeps the server running after the checks, to open
the page in a browser of your own. The work folder (`--work`) gets the
stack's screenshot and the IDE's lines. An IDE without CEF (Linux arm64)
has no browser widget, so neither has what it builds: the check then
accepts the probe's report that the widget is not there, but only when
the IDE said so too.

The jobs that make the packages run it on them (`--install`), and the
Linux build's job "Web runtime check" on the web runtime alone
(`--runtime`).

### Web engine tests

[`tools/ci/web_tests.py`](tools/ci/web_tests.py) runs the LiveCode
Script tests of `tests/lcs` in the web engine, as the
[engine tests](#engine-tests) run them in the desktop's. It compiles
the LiveCode Builder modules of `tests/` with the build's `lc-compile`,
makes a web standalone of the tests with the build's development engine
(as the [web standalone check](#web-standalone-check) does with
`--runtime`), serves it on 127.0.0.1 and opens it in headless Chromium.
The standalone's main stack,
[`tools/ci/web-tests.livecodescript`](tools/ci/web-tests.livecodescript),
runs the test commands one after the other, each with the test runner's
set-up and clean-up, and writes their results to the browser's console.
A test that quits is told it did (the quit is cancelled), and a test
that never ends, or stops the engine, fails; the page is then opened
again at the next test. Tests that need what a page cannot have skip
there through the test library's requirements: sockets and other
programs (`sockets` and `shell` in
[`tests/_testlib.livecodescript`](tests/_testlib.livecodescript)), and
the IDE and the LiveCode Builder compiler (the tests run in a
standalone).

```sh
python3 tools/ci/web_tests.py --runtime <web runtime> --bin linux-x86_64-bin
```

`--runtime` is the [web runtime](#14-building-the-web-engine) and
`--bin` a build output folder, with `lc-compile` and the development
engine that writes the standalone's startup data (`--engine` names
another). `--filter` takes a regular expression that the test's name must
match, `--timeout` is the seconds a test may take (120). Failures are
compared with
[`tools/ci/web-tests-baseline.txt`](tools/ci/web-tests-baseline.txt) as
the engine tests compare theirs: one not in it is run again on a page of
its own, and only reported as flaky when it then passes; else it fails
the check (exit code 1). `--update-baseline` rewrites the file. The log
(`--log`, by default `web-tests.log` in the work folder, `--work`) has
the output of every failed test and what the browser's console said
while it ran.

The Linux x86-64 package job runs it on its build and the web runtime
it packages.

### IDE screenshots

[`tools/ci/ui_tour.py`](tools/ci/ui_tour.py) looks at the IDE's own
windows, which no other check does: the other checks run the engine with
`-ui` or with a test stack, and the palettes, the Inspector, the editors
and the dialogs are stacks with colours of their own. It sets the
system's appearance (`--appearance light` or `dark`: on macOS
`AppleInterfaceStyle`, on Windows the apps and system mode, on Linux the
Adwaita or Adwaita-dark GTK 2 theme of `gnome-themes-extra`, else a
gtkrc of plain colours), restores it at the end, and starts the
installed IDE as a user does with
[`tools/ci/ui-tour.livecodescript`](tools/ci/ui-tour.livecodescript)
named on the command line. The script opens the palettes, each section
of the Inspector, the script editor, the message box, each pane of
Preferences and each card of the Standalone Settings, LiveCode's
Dictionary (whose page must report the entries of both languages and
of the extensions' widgets and show the entry for `try`), its guides
(each once, and the Printing guide with its images), the text
dictionary (on its entry for `try`, whose bullets must show, as they
did not while the entries were read as native text instead of UTF-8,
and whose links of one word and of two must be linked whole),
the other editors and some dialogs one by one, shows two tooltips and a
shape of the Tools palette under the pointer, and snapshots the screen
around each. The snapshots stay in `<out>/shots`
and are printed into the output, from which
[`tools/ci/print_images.py`](tools/ci/print_images.py) rebuilds them.
A step that fails, or a script error in the IDE's windows, fails the
check. `--only` runs some of the steps, named as the script's `kSteps`
names them (for example `--only appearance,tooltip-tools`).

```sh
sudo apt-get install xvfb gnome-themes-extra gtk2-engines-pixbuf
python3 tools/ci/ui_tour.py --install <folder> --appearance dark --out <folder>
```

Every build runs it light and dark (pull requests, `main` and
releases): on the Windows staged IDE, the Linux packages and the Mac app
on both architectures.
[`ui-tour.yml`](.github/workflows/ui-tour.yml) runs it on the packages of
a published release (by hand, for any tag), and on the latest release for
a pull request that changes the tour, where the release's own problems
only warn.

To look through them, each of those jobs uploads the snapshots, with the
script's lines of each appearance (`tour.txt`), as an artifact of their
own, `ide-screenshots-<platform>` in a build
(`win-x86_64`, `linux-x86_64`, `linux-arm64`, `mac-universal-arm64`,
`mac-universal-x86_64`) and `ui-tour-<platform>-<runner>` in
`ui-tour.yml`, kept 14 days, and its job summary links the download.
Unzip it and open `index.html`: each window light and dark side by side,
each a link to the full-size snapshot, with the steps that failed and the
script errors at the top.
[`tools/ci/ui_tour_page.py`](tools/ci/ui_tour_page.py) writes that page
from the folder with `light/` and `dark/` (the tours' `--out`):

```sh
python3 tools/ci/ui_tour_page.py <folder> --title "Linux x86_64"
```

The newest snapshots of the builds of `main` are also on the branch
[`ide-screenshots`](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/tree/ide-screenshots),
where GitHub shows them with nothing to download: a page for each
platform with each window light and dark side by side, and at the top a
line for each platform with the build they came from. When one of the
build workflows finishes a run on a push to `main`,
[`ide-screenshots.yml`](.github/workflows/ide-screenshots.yml) runs
[`tools/ci/ide_screenshots_branch.py`](tools/ci/ide_screenshots_branch.py),
which downloads the newest `ide-screenshots-<platform>` artifact of each
platform from the builds of main and writes those pages, and replaces the
branch with one commit of them, pushed with `--force`: only the newest
are kept, so the branch (about 25 MB) does not grow. A pull request that
changes the workflow or the script tries them, as it stands in the pull
request, on the newest finished builds of its branch and uploads the
result, as the artifact `ide-screenshots-branch`, instead. The pull
request's own builds start at the same time, so those are of an earlier
commit (or there are none yet, for a new branch): this checks the steps,
not the screenshots, which the builds' own artifacts have.

```sh
GH_REPO=<owner>/<repo> python3 tools/ci/ide_screenshots_branch.py download <folder>
python3 tools/ci/ide_screenshots_branch.py pages <folder> <out>
```

### Installer

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\build-installer.ps1
```

[`tools/ci/build-installer.ps1`](tools/ci/build-installer.ps1) compiles
[`Installer/oxt-beyond/oxt-beyond.iss`](Installer/oxt-beyond/oxt-beyond.iss)
with Inno Setup 6.3 or later over the staged layout (default
`dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>`) into
`dist\OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-setup.exe`, then rewrites
`dist\SHA256SUMS` over all files in `dist`. It looks for `ISCC.exe` in
`-Iscc`, the usual Inno Setup 6 folders, Inno Setup's uninstall
registration and `PATH`; if it finds none, it runs
`choco install innosetup -y --no-progress` (which needs Chocolatey and
administrator rights), unless you pass `-NoInstall`. The wizard images
are made from the icon art by
[`Installer/oxt-beyond/make-wizard-images.ps1`](Installer/oxt-beyond/make-wizard-images.ps1)
in a temporary folder (`-NoWizardImages` uses Inno Setup's own). Other
options: `-Stage`, `-OutDir`, `-Version`, `-BuildNumber` and `-LogFile`.
The `.iss` script can also be compiled on its own in the Inno Setup
IDE; it then reads the version from `ide/.version` and expects the stage
in `dist\stage`.

What the installer does:

- It has a fixed `AppId`, so a newer version replaces an installed one.
  Before installing over an older version it deletes the `Toolset`,
  `Extensions`, `Externals`, `Toolchain` and `Runtime` folders, so no
  file that the new version no longer ships is left behind. It deletes
  the dictionaries' data too (in
  `Documentation\html_viewer\resources\data`, the `api_livecode_script`
  and `api_livecode_builder` folders and the text dictionary's
  `api\exports\<xtalk|builder|datagrid>\resaved` folders), so an older
  version's entries do not show up next to the new ones. The entries a
  user adds to the text dictionary, in `api\exports\<...>\plugins`, stay.
- It installs for all users into `C:\Program Files\OXT-Beyond` (with
  administrator rights) or, if chosen on its first page or with
  `/CURRENTUSER`, for the current user into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OXT-Beyond`.
- It shows `LICENSE` as the licence page, adds a Start menu shortcut
  and, optionally, a desktop shortcut, and optionally associates
  `.oxtstack` and `.oxtscript` files with `OXT-Beyond.exe "%1"` (program
  IDs `OXTBeyond.Stack` and `OXTBeyond.Script`; `.livecode` is left
  alone). The IDE no longer shows OpenXTalk Lite's own "File
  Associations" dialog on Windows (`ide/Toolset/home.livecodescript`),
  so it does not register `.rev`, `.livecode` or `.livecodescript`
  either.
- The IDE writes to some data files inside the program folder at run
  time. In an install for all users, the Users group gets Modify
  permission on these data files: the dictionary's
  `Documentation\html_viewer\resources\data\api\exports` folder, and
  `Toolset\palettes\updates\whatsnew.txt` and `updatehistory\*.txt`
  (opened with `open file`, which opens a file for reading and
  writing). No folder or file with stacks, scripts or programs is made
  writable, so the few places where the IDE saves stacks inside the
  program folder fail for standard users in an install for all users:
  the Report Builder plugin saving itself when it closes, *Plugin
  Settings* changes to the plugins that come with OXT-Beyond, and edits
  to the built-in image libraries (see the README's
  [known limitations](README.md#known-limitations-and-plans)). An
  install for the current user, or the portable zip, does not have this
  problem.
- The uninstaller removes the program files, shortcuts and file
  associations, but not the preferences, caches and logs in
  `%APPDATA%\OXT-Beyond` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OXT-Beyond`.
- Setup always writes a log to `%TEMP%`.

### Test the installer

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ci\test-installer.ps1 -Setup dist\OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-setup.exe
```

[`tools/ci/test-installer.ps1`](tools/ci/test-installer.ps1) installs
the setup program silently for the current user into a new temporary
folder (`/CURRENTUSER /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /DIR=...`,
with the desktop shortcut) and checks the exit code. Then it puts
dictionary entries of an older version and text dictionary entries of
a user in the folder, installs again over them, as a newer version is
installed over an older one, and checks that the older version's
entries are gone and the user's are kept. It checks the key files, that
every staged file was installed with the same size, `.version`, the
uninstall registration, the shortcuts, the file associations and the
Modify permissions, runs the smoke test on the installed
`OXT-Beyond.exe`, then uninstalls silently and checks that everything
was removed. It refuses to run if OXT-Beyond is already installed for
your user, and it leaves the file associations out if `.oxtstack` or
`.oxtscript` already open with another program. It changes your user
account while it runs (registry, Start menu, desktop), so a test
computer or virtual machine is a good place for it. Options:
`-InstallDir`, `-Stage`, `-LogDir`, `-TimeoutSeconds` and
`-SkipSmokeTest`.

### Development and installed layouts

| | Development layout (your clone) | Installed layout (`dist\stage`, portable zip, installer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine | `win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe` | `OXT-Beyond.exe` at the root |
| IDE | `ide\` and `ide-support\`, where they are in the repository | `Toolset\`, `Plugins\`, `Resources\`, `Documentation\` |
| Externals and database drivers | `win-x86_64-bin\` | `Externals\`, `Externals\Database Drivers\`, `Externals\CEF\` |
| Extensions | only the build's (`win-x86_64-bin\packaged_extensions`) | `Extensions\`: the build's, those in `ide/Extensions` (OXT Lite functions, DevGuides alignment guides, Calendar, Pie Chart, macOS Native Tools) and the [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) |
| Standalone runtimes | the build's Windows x86-64 engine | `Runtime\Windows\x86-64\` from the build, and the other platforms from the runtimes asset |
| Version and build number | `ide\.version`, `ide\.buildnumber` (`0`) | `.version`, `.buildnumber` (the real build number) at the root |
| `revEnvironmentIsInstalled()` | false | true |
| Used for | working on the engine and the IDE | what users run; what CI tests |

Tom Perry's IDE was made for, and tested in, the installed layout, and
the IDE has code paths for each layout, so check IDE changes in both. To
run the installed layout without installing it, start
`dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>\OXT-Beyond.exe`; but make your changes in
the repository, not in `dist\stage`, which the next packaging run
replaces.

## 8. Troubleshooting

Look in `build-win-x86_64\msbuild.log` for the first `error` line; the
lines before it usually show which step failed.

**"Cannot locate a Cygwin installation".** Install Cygwin into
`C:\cygwin64` (section 2.5), or set `CYGPATH` to its root folder.

**flex, bison or `/usr/bin/...` "No such file or directory".** The
shell steps ran in the wrong bash. When Cygwin is not in `CYGPATH`,
`C:\cygwin64` or `C:\cygwin`, `invoke-unix.bat` falls back to the first
`cygpath.exe` on `PATH`, which is often Git for Windows' `usr\bin`, and
Git's bash has no flex or bison. Install Cygwin as described, and keep
Git's `usr\bin`, MSYS2 and Cygwin itself off `PATH`.

**Messages from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instead of Cygwin.** A
plain `bash` typed in `cmd.exe` usually starts
`C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, the WSL launcher, not Cygwin. When you
run shell commands by hand (such as the manual fetch in section 6), call
Cygwin's bash by its full path, `C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe`.

**Python errors while configuring**, such as
`SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'` or a syntax error
at `except OSError, e:`. That is Python 3 running Python 2 code. Run
`C:\Python27\python.exe config.py ...` (or set `PYTHON` for
`configure.bat`).

**MSB8036: "The Windows SDK version 8.1 was not found"** (or another
version). The projects do not name an SDK, so `make.cmd` passes one.
Set `WINSDK_VERSION` to an installed SDK and build again, for example
`set WINSDK_VERSION=10.0.17763.0`. The installed versions are the folder
names in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include`.

**Compile errors in Windows SDK headers.** The only earlier build of
this code known to work (Tom Perry's) compiled against the Windows 8.1
SDK. SDK 10.0.22621.0 fails with C2059/C2238 in `winnt.h` while compiling
`kernel-installer` with v141, which is why CI selects 10.0.17763.0. A
newer SDK may expose other problems that have not been seen before.
As a fallback, install the Windows 8.1 SDK (the Visual Studio 2022
installer does not offer it; Microsoft's
[Windows SDK archive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-sdk/downloads-archive)
does), then `set WINSDK_VERSION=8.1` and build again. Please also report
the error in an issue.

**MSB8020: "The build tools for v141 cannot be found".** The v141
toolset is not installed in the Visual Studio that `make.cmd` picked.
Add the components from section 2.1, or point `VSINSTALLDIR` at the
installation that has them.

**`atlbase.h` or `afxres.h` not found.** The v141 ATL or MFC component
is missing (section 2.1).

**The build fails in a folder with spaces in its name.** Move or clone
the repository to a path without spaces, such as `C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond`.

**Downloading CEF fails**, or reports a SHA-1 mismatch
(`prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1`). A mismatching file is deleted,
so running the script again retries the download. Behind a proxy or
firewall, download the file named in the message from
<https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com> some other way and put it into
`prebuilt\build\windows\downloads`; the script checks its SHA-1 before
using it (section 6).

**"failed to find library OpenSSL-..." (or Curl, ICU, Thirdparty)
during the build.** The prebuilt libraries have not been built: run
`prebuilt\build-libraries-windows.ps1` (section 6). For a Debug build,
run it with `-Mode debug` as well.

**`build-libraries-windows.ps1` stops** with "NASM not found" (install
NASM), "cl.exe of MSVC 14.16 (v141) is not first on PATH" (the v141
toolset is missing: section 2.1), "cmake.exe not found" (install CMake)
or a missing Cygwin tool (add `make` to Cygwin, section 2.5). ICU's
configure and build run in Cygwin's bash; their output, and
`prebuilt\build\windows\icu-<triple>-build\config.log`, show what went
wrong.

**LNK1104: cannot open file `libcef.lib`, `libcrypto.lib` and so on.**
The prebuilt libraries are not unpacked for the configuration you are
building. Check that `prebuilt\unpacked\<Library>\x86_64-win32-v141_static_release`
(or `_debug` for a Debug build) exists. If in doubt, delete
`prebuilt\unpacked` and build again; the archives in `prebuilt\fetched`
are unpacked again.

**LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'.** A Debug build found
a Release library, or the other way round, usually because a library was
copied into `prebuilt\unpacked` by hand. Delete `prebuilt\unpacked` and
build again.

**The command prompt closes when the build finishes.** Run
`cmd /c ..\make.cmd` rather than `..\make.cmd`.

**Packaging fails to download the runtimes asset**
(`oxt-runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2.zip`). The download comes from this
repository's `runtimes-0.2.5-rc.2` release (also in a fork, which needs
no copy of its own), so a failure is usually the network:
a proxy or firewall, or no access to `github.com` and its download
servers. Copy the file into the cache folder, where it is used without
downloading when its size and SHA-256 match (see
[External assets](#external-assets)), or package with
`-NoExternalAssets`. In CI, start the workflow by hand with
`no_external_assets`, or set the repository variable
`OXT_NO_EXTERNAL_ASSETS` to `1`.

**An external asset's size or SHA-256 does not match** ("expected ..."
in the message). The downloaded file is not the one the manifest pins,
and packaging stops. A cached copy that does
not match is downloaded again automatically; a fresh download that
does not match means the published file has changed or the download was
tampered with. Report it; do not update the manifest to match a file
you have not checked.

**`package-windows.ps1` finds no Python 3.** Install Python 3 (section
2.6) or pass `-Python C:\path\to\python.exe`. Python 2.7 is not enough
for packaging.

**`build-installer.ps1` cannot find `ISCC.exe`.** Install Inno Setup 6.3
or later (section 2.7) or pass `-Iscc C:\path\to\ISCC.exe`. The automatic
Chocolatey install needs Chocolatey and an elevated prompt.

**`test-installer.ps1` refuses to run.** OXT-Beyond is installed for
your user. Uninstall it first, or run the test in another account or on
a test computer.

### Line endings

With Git for Windows' default `core.autocrlf=true`, text files are
checked out with Windows (CRLF) line endings. This is the configuration
the existing builds used. Whatever your setting, `.gitattributes` forces
Unix (LF) line endings for the files that bash reads, such as `*.sh`,
`*.inc`, `prebuilt/versions/*` and `prebuilt/SHA256SUMS`, and Windows
(CRLF) line endings for `*.bat` and `*.cmd` files, which `cmd.exe` can
misread otherwise.

If bash reports `$'\r': command not found`, a shell script has CRLF line
endings, usually because it was edited with a Windows editor or the tree
did not come from `git clone`. Restore it with
`git checkout -- <file>`, and save shell scripts with LF line endings.
Do not change `core.autocrlf` in an existing clone; if you want a
different setting, make a fresh clone.

## 9. Continuous integration

The workflow [`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`](.github/workflows/build-windows.yml)
("Build (Windows)") builds OXT-Beyond on GitHub's `windows-2022`
runners. It runs on every push and pull request to `main` and when
started by hand from the Actions tab; for a release,
[`release.yml`](#10-making-a-release) calls it (not on tags of its own).
A push or pull request that changes nothing a platform's build uses
starts no build of that platform: documentation (the Markdown files at
the top of the repository, the issue forms and the pull request
template), the workflows and scripts that build nothing (`release.yml`,
`runtimes.yml`, `tag-release.yml`, the screenshot and check-by-hand
workflows, `ci-checks.yml` and `tools/ci/tests`), and what only the
other platforms use (their build workflows, the `.ps1` scripts for
Windows, and so on). Each build workflow lists these in its
`paths-ignore`; a file that is not listed starts the build, and
`tools/ci/tests` checks that no list has a file its own workflow uses.
The dictionary and guides in `docs/` are built into the IDE, so changing
them still starts the builds.

"CI checks" ([`.github/workflows/ci-checks.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-checks.yml))
runs on every pull request and push to `main` in a minute or two:
[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) on every workflow, and
the unit tests of the CI scripts in `tools/ci/tests`
(`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/ci/tests`, which needs PyYAML).

It follows this guide:

1. It reads the product version from `ide/.version` (a tag build fails
   straight away if the tag is not `v` followed by that version) and
   sets `OXT_BUILD_NUMBER` to the UTC time of the commit
   (`YYYYMMDDHHMM`), so every file of every platform's build of the
   commit has the same build number, the one `release.yml` gives a
   release of it.
2. Before the long build, it runs `tools/ci/check_ide_stacks.py` with
   the runner's Python 3.8 or later: every script patch of
   `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches` is applied to the binary IDE stacks (see
   [Working on the IDE](#11-working-on-the-ide)).
3. It adds the v141 components to the runner's Visual Studio 2022 with
   `tools/ci/install-vs-components.ps1` and installs Python 2.7 and
   Cygwin. The files the Visual Studio installer adds are cached
   (`tools/ci/vs-toolset-cache.ps1`), keyed on the runner image, which
   saves the installer's five minutes: the job "Build win-x86" of main's
   builds saves them, and every job restores them first, so the script
   finds the toolset complete. It takes the prebuilt libraries (section 6) from its cache, or,
   when their versions, build script or sources changed, installs NASM
   and builds them with `prebuilt/build-libraries-windows.ps1` (OpenSSL,
   curl, ICU and CEF, then Thirdparty, Release x86_64, about 40 minutes)
   and caches them; then it fetches them from there
   (`PREBUILT_STRICT=1`: an archive that had to be downloaded instead
   would fail the step).
4. It configures and builds Release x64 with `tools/ci/build-windows.ps1`
   and Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0, and checks the result with
   `tools/ci/verify-build.ps1`.
5. It packages with `tools/ci/package-windows.ps1`, with the
   documentation of the job Docs and the web runtime of the job Web
   (both below): the installed layout
   in `dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>` and the portable, binaries and
   symbols zips. The external assets' archives are cached from
   `prebuilt\fetched-assets\*.zip` between runs, keyed on the manifest. They
   are left out (`-NoExternalAssets`, with a warning in the run) when
   the workflow is started by hand with the input `no_external_assets`,
   or when the repository variable `OXT_NO_EXTERNAL_ASSETS` is `1`, for
   example while a new asset is not published yet. Release builds (the
   runs `release.yml` calls, its dry runs included) always include them.
   The files of the
   [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) are cached in
   `prebuilt\fetched-assets\xtalk`, keyed on their manifest; they are
   left out with the input `no_xtalk_extensions` or the variable
   `OXT_NO_XTALK_EXTENSIONS`, except in release builds, which also write
   `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-xtalk-sources.zip` (see
   [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions)), the one copy of it
   that a release carries for all platforms. `package-windows.ps1`
   finds the runner's Visual C++ redistributable folder with `vswhere`
   and bundles the runtime DLLs that enetxt and Box2Dxt need;
   `tools/ci/check-extension-imports.ps1` then checks that every Windows
   DLL under `Extensions` finds its imports.
6. It runs the [smoke test](#smoke-test) on the portable zip (including
   the xTalk Suite extensions), the
   [standalone check](#standalone-check) on it (a Windows x86-64
   standalone built and run), the
   [IDE compile check](#ide-compile-check) on the staged layout, the
   [engine tests](#engine-tests) on the build output, builds
   the [installer](#installer) and [tests it](#test-the-installer):
   install for the current user, smoke test of the installed program,
   uninstall. Then the [web standalone check](#web-standalone-check)
   makes an HTML5 standalone with the staged IDE and opens it in
   headless Chromium.

It uploads four artifacts:

- `OXT-Beyond-win-x86_64`: when every step succeeds, the files in
  `dist\` (the installer, the three zips, in release builds the xTalk
  sources zip, and `SHA256SUMS`; not the staged folder), kept for 30
  days;
- `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-win-x86_64-setup.exe`: the same installer alone and
  not zipped (uploaded with `archive: false`, so the artifact is the
  file and takes its name), for trying a build without downloading the
  whole set; kept for 14 days, and never part of a release;
- `build-logs-win-x86_64`: `msbuild.log` and the logs of packaging, the
  smoke test, the standalone check, the IDE compile check, the engine
  tests and building and testing the installer, kept
  for 14 days and uploaded even when the build fails;
- `prebuilt-libraries-win-x86_64`: the prebuilt library archives the
  build used (OpenSSL, curl, ICU, CEF and Thirdparty, Release x86_64;
  see [Prebuilt libraries](#6-prebuilt-libraries)), kept for 30 days.

A second job, "Build win-x86", builds the 32-bit engine the same way
(`prebuilt/build-libraries-windows.ps1 -Arch x86`, `BUILD_PLATFORM`
`win-x86`, with its own cache) for its standalone runtime. It checks it
like the x86-64 build (`verify-build.ps1`, the smoke test and the engine
tests, as 32-bit programs, and the [standalone check](#standalone-check)
with a standalone built from its runtime and run) and uploads `win-x86-bin`
without its `.pdb` files as the artifact `OXT-Beyond-win-x86-bin` (the
`.pdb` files as `OXT-Beyond-win-x86-symbols`). It is not packaged: the
packages take its runtime from the runtimes asset (see
[External assets](#external-assets)).

When a step fails, a "Failure diagnostics" table in the job summary
shows which step it was. Downloading artifacts requires a GitHub
account. Public downloads are Releases.

The badges at the top of the [README](README.md) and the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions)
show the state of the latest runs.

Dependabot ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)) checks
every week for newer versions of the GitHub Actions the workflows use
and opens one pull request (`ci: bump the github-actions group ...`)
with all of them; like any pull request, it is merged once the three build
workflows pass. Nothing else is tracked: the build's sources and
prebuilt archives are pinned in the repository.

The Linux workflow ([`.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`](.github/workflows/build-linux.yml),
"Build (Linux)") builds x86-64 and arm64 in an Ubuntu 20.04 container
(see [Building on Linux](#12-building-on-linux)). Its job "Package
linux-x86_64" then makes and tests the [Linux package](#linux-package)
on `ubuntu-24.04` (the [standalone check](#standalone-check) among the
tests) and uploads it as the artifact `OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64`; the
header of the workflow file lists its steps. Its job "Build linux-x86"
builds the 32-bit engine for its standalone runtime in a Debian 11 i386
container (`tools/ci/i386-container.sh`: Ubuntu has no i386 images
after 18.04, and Debian 11 has the same glibc 2.31 floor), checks it
as the other legs do, plus the standalone check, and uploads
`OXT-Beyond-linux-x86-bin`; it is not packaged either. It takes the same `no_external_assets` and `no_xtalk_extensions`
inputs and repository variables as the Windows workflow.

The macOS workflow ([`.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`](.github/workflows/build-macos.yml),
"Build (macOS)") builds arm64 on `macos-15` and x86_64 on
`macos-15-intel` (see [Building on macOS](#13-building-on-macos)). Its
job "Package mac-universal" joins the two into one universal
[macOS app](#macos-app), signed ad hoc, and uploads it as the artifact
`OXT-Beyond-mac-universal`; "Test mac-universal (arm64)" and "(x86_64)"
then install it from the disk image on each architecture and test it
(the signature, the smoke test, the IDE compile check, a standalone,
the IDE started as a user starts it, the field speed check with the Mac
light and dark, and the [IDE screenshots](#ide-screenshots); see [macOS app](#macos-app)). The IDE start
([`tools/ci/mac_ide_start.sh`](tools/ci/mac_ide_start.sh)) runs the app
with its home stack, menu bar and palettes and fails if it is not still
running after 90 seconds, printing the faulting thread of the crash
report macOS wrote; every other step runs the engine with `-ui` or with a
test stack of its own.
The repository variables `OXT_NO_EXTERNAL_ASSETS` and
`OXT_NO_XTALK_EXTENSIONS` work there too.

Each build workflow also runs the job "Docs"
([`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml)): on one
`ubuntu-24.04` runner, in a few minutes, it generates the
[documentation](#documentation) with `tools/ci/build_docs.sh` and
uploads it as the artifact `OXT-Beyond-docs-<windows|linux|macos>`
(30 days), which the jobs that package put into their checkout. The
Windows build waits for it before it starts; the Linux and macOS
package jobs need it. When it fails, they fail too.

Each build workflow also runs the job "Web"
([`.github/workflows/web.yml`](.github/workflows/web.yml)), which builds
the web runtime in an Ubuntu 22.04 container (see
[Building the web engine](#14-building-the-web-engine)) and uploads it
as the artifact `OXT-Beyond-web-<windows|linux|macos>` (30 days); the
jobs that package install it in `Runtime/Emscripten/js` (with
`OXT_WEB_RUNTIME`), and fail when it failed, as for the job Docs. It
takes the runtime from the Actions cache when nothing it is built from
changed (the top-level folders and files of the repository but `ide`,
`ide-support`, `docs`, `tests`, `tools`, `Installer`, `.github` and the
Markdown files, and `tools/ci/build-web.sh`), so a commit that changes
only those builds nothing; otherwise it takes the libraries, the
Emscripten SDK and ccache's cache of the compiled files from the cache,
and builds the engine. In the Linux workflow it also runs the
[web standalone check](#web-standalone-check) on the runtime, in the job
"Web runtime check".

The Linux and macOS builds also upload their build outputs, without the
build's own tools (GENTLE among them, which may not be redistributed;
see `tools/ci/list_build_tools.py`), as `OXT-Beyond-<platform>-<arch>-bin`
and their debug symbols as `-symbols` (30 days); their logs are kept for
14 days. The checks of all three workflows are required for pull
requests into `main`: "Build win-x86_64", "Build linux-x86_64", "Build
linux-arm64", "Package linux-x86_64", "Build mac-arm64", "Build
mac-x86_64", "Package mac-universal", "Test mac-universal (arm64)" and
"Test mac-universal (x86_64)". The 32-bit builds, "Build win-x86" and
"Build linux-x86", run with them but are not in that list.

The workflow [`.github/workflows/runtimes.yml`](.github/workflows/runtimes.yml)
("Runtimes asset") is only started by hand: it makes the runtimes asset
from the outputs of one Windows and one Linux run and can publish it
(see [External assets](#external-assets)).

The workflow [`.github/workflows/ide-screenshots.yml`](.github/workflows/ide-screenshots.yml)
("IDE screenshots (branch)") runs when one of the three build workflows
finishes a run on a push to `main`, and keeps the newest IDE screenshots
of each platform on the branch `ide-screenshots` (see
[IDE screenshots](#ide-screenshots)).

## 10. Making a release

Releases are built by CI from a tag: the workflow
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)
("Release") builds, packages and tests Windows, macOS and Linux from the
tagged commit and publishes one GitHub Release with the files of all
three. The product version is the content of `ide/.version` (for
example `0.1.0`); the tag is `v` followed by it (`v0.1.0`). The engine
version in the `version` file (9.7.1-OXT, build 25923) is separate:
change it only when the engine changes, and then also check
`tools/ci/verify-build.ps1` and the smoke test, which compare against
it.

1. Make sure the external assets in `tools/oxt/external-assets.json`
   are published (see [External assets](#external-assets)); packaging
   fails without them. Decide whether the xTalk Suite extensions should
   move to newer commits of their repositories; if so, pin them (see
   [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions)) and merge that
   first.
2. Set `ide/.version` to the new version, for example `0.1.0`, or
   `0.1.0-beta.1` for a pre-release. Update the README's status and
   limitations if they changed. Leave `ide/.buildnumber` at `0`.
   `ide/.codename` holds the release name ("Frankenstein" for 0.2.1),
   which the About window shows and the GitHub release's title carries;
   change it for a release with a new name, together with its artwork
   (`Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/README.md`).
   Add a section for the version at the top of
   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), one line per commit since the previous
   release with the number of the pull request that brought it in:
   `git log --reverse --no-merges --format="- %s" v0.1.0..main` gives
   the lines (with the previous release's tag), and
   `git log --first-parent --merges --format="%h %s" v0.1.0..main` the
   pull requests.
   Run `python3 tools/oxt/legacy_todo.py` so that
   [LEGACY-TODO.md](LEGACY-TODO.md) lists the notes, and their lines, of
   the code being released.
3. Merge that change into `main` through a pull request and wait for the
   checks of all three build workflows to pass.
4. Do a [dry run](#dry-run) on `main` and look at its release files and
   notes (recommended; it takes as long as a release).
5. Tag the merged commit and push the tag:

   ```bat
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "OXT-Beyond 0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

   Without the right to push tags (from a cloud session, for example),
   wait until the three build workflows have passed on `main`'s latest
   commit and run the "Tag a release" workflow
   ([`.github/workflows/tag-release.yml`](.github/workflows/tag-release.yml))
   on `main` instead: it tags that commit `v<ide/.version>`, refuses a
   tag that exists already or a commit whose builds did not pass, and
   starts `release.yml` on the new tag, which then does what step 6 says.
   (When the commit's push started no build, because it changed nothing
   a build uses, it starts the builds on `main` instead; run it again once
   they have passed.)

6. The tag starts `release.yml`:
   - **Prepare the release** checks `ide/.version` and that the tag is
     `v` followed by it exactly (a tag that is not stops the run before
     anything is built), stops if a release of the tag is published
     already, and chooses one build number (the UTC time of the commit,
     `YYYYMMDDHHMM`) for every platform. It then looks for `main`'s
     builds of the commit: for each platform, a run of its build workflow
     on `main` for this very commit (its push, or a run by hand there)
     that passed, left nothing out of its packages, and still has them
     (artifacts are kept 30 days), waiting for one that is still running.
     Such a build made the same packages a release build would (same
     workflow, same build number, every asset and extension, and the
     xTalk sources zip), so that platform is **not built again**: publish
     takes its packages from that run. "Tag a release" tags only a commit
     whose three builds passed, so its releases normally build nothing.
   - **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**, for each platform with no such
     build of `main`, run `build-windows.yml`,
     `build-linux.yml` and `build-macos.yml` as reusable workflows, with
     every build, package and test job they run for a pull request (the
     jobs show as "Windows / Build win-x86_64" and so on), as release
     builds: the external assets and xTalk Suite extensions are always
     included, and the Windows job writes the xTalk sources zip.
   - **Publish GitHub Release** runs only when every one of those jobs
     passed (or was not needed). It downloads the package artifacts, from
     this run or from `main`'s build,
     (`OXT-Beyond-win-x86_64`, `OXT-Beyond-mac-universal`,
     `OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64`), checks each against its own
     `SHA256SUMS` and against the release's list of files
     ([`tools/ci/release_assets.py`](tools/ci/release_assets.py)), and
     writes one `SHA256SUMS` over all of them. It writes the notes
     ([`tools/ci/release_notes.py`](tools/ci/release_notes.py)), creates
     the release "OXT-Beyond <version>" (followed by the release name
     of `ide/.codename` in quotes, for example
     `OXT-Beyond 0.2.1-rc.8 “Frankenstein”`) as a **draft** with those notes
     followed by GitHub's generated list of changes since the previous
     release (the latest published release whose tag starts with `v`,
     not an asset's `runtimes-*` or `prebuilts-*` tag), uploads every file,
     checks what GitHub now holds (names, sizes and SHA-256), and only
     then **publishes** the draft.

   A version with a pre-release part (anything after a `-`, such as
   `0.1.0-beta.1` or `0.1.0-rc.1`) becomes a pre-release; the update
   check orders versions and offers pre-releases the same way. The
   release's files:

   | Platform | Files (`OXT-Beyond-<version>-...`) |
   | --- | --- |
   | Windows x86-64 | `win-x86_64-setup.exe`, `win-x86_64-portable.zip`, `win-x86_64-binaries.zip`, `win-x86_64-symbols.zip` |
   | macOS universal | `mac-universal.dmg`, `mac-universal.zip`, `mac-universal-binaries.tar.xz`, `mac-universal-symbols.zip` |
   | Linux x86-64 | `linux-x86_64.tar.xz`, `linux-x86_64-binaries.tar.xz`, `linux-x86_64-symbols.tar.xz` |
   | Other xTalks' IDEs | `xtalk-assistant-plugin.lce`, `mcp-bridge-plugin.lce` (built by the publish job, `tools/plugins`) |
   | All | `xtalk-sources.zip`, and `SHA256SUMS` |

   Edit the notes afterwards if needed: say what changed and repeat the
   known limitations from the README, below the opening lines. Keep the
   first twelve lines as they are, or as short and platform-neutral:
   the IDE's update check shows every user those lines (at most 700
   characters, as plain text).
7. Check that GitHub shows the new release as the latest one, for
   example with
   `gh api repos/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases/latest --jq .tag_name`.
   OXT-Beyond's update check reads that release (and the list of
   releases, if it is not an OXT-Beyond version or the user runs a
   pre-release). If another release is
   marked latest, fix it with
   `gh release edit v0.1.0 --latest --repo SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond`.
   Pre-releases are never "latest"; the update check offers them only to
   people who already run a pre-release. After a pre-release, check the
   other way round: the latest release must still be the last one
   without a pre-release part, and the new one must be marked as a
   pre-release
   (`gh release view v0.1.0-rc.1 --json isPrerelease --repo SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond`).
   Number release candidates `-rc.1`, `-rc.2` and so on: the update check
   compares the parts after the `-` as SemVer does, so `-rc.10` comes
   after `-rc.2`, where `-RC10` would come before `-RC2`.

The `gh` commands here name the repository (with `--repo`, or in the API
path): a clone that also has LiveCode's repository as a remote may
otherwise send them there.

GitHub also attaches source code archives of the tagged commit to the
release. They include `ide/` and `thirdparty/`, which are part of this
repository. The runtimes asset has its own release and names its
sources in its `PROVENANCE.md`.

### Dry run

A dry run does everything a release does except the calls that create
it: it builds, packages and tests the three platforms, assembles and
checks the release files, writes the notes, and uploads the files as
the artifact `release-dry-run` (30 days); the notes, and the lines the
update check would show, are in the summary of its last job. It creates
no release, no draft and no tag. Start it on the Actions tab (*Release*,
*Run workflow*, pick the branch, usually `main`, and leave *Dry run*
ticked), or with the GitHub CLI:

```bat
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f dry-run=true --repo SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond
```

The files are named after `ide/.version` of that branch. A dry run of
`main` takes `main`'s builds of the commit, as a release does; tick
*Rebuild* (`-f rebuild=true`) to build every platform anyway. A run started
by hand without *Dry run* must be started on the tag `v<version>` (it
then publishes as a push of the tag does); on a branch it stops at once.

### When a release run fails

Nothing is published until every platform's files are uploaded and
checked, so a failure (a build, a test, a check, an upload) leaves at
most a **draft** release: only people with write access to the
repository see drafts, and the update check ignores them. The version is
not burned.

- **A passing problem** (a runner, the network, a flaky test): open the
  run and choose *Re-run failed jobs*. The publish job then reuses the
  draft of the tag, if there is one: its title and notes stay as they
  are (edit them on the Releases page if you like), the files are
  uploaded again, and it is published when everything is in. The draft
  must still name the run's commit: an edit of its notes must keep the
  line `Made by the "Release" workflow ... from commit <sha>`. A draft
  made from another commit (left by a run before the tag was moved) is
  refused, not published: delete it and re-run the job.
- **A problem in the code:** delete the draft, if there is one (on the
  Releases page; a new run's publish job refuses a draft of the old
  commit rather than publish its notes), fix the problem on `main`
  through a pull request, and release the fixed commit. Since nothing
  was published, you may delete the tag and tag the fixed commit with
  the same version (`git tag -d v0.1.0` and
  `git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0`, then steps 5 and 6), or tag a
  new version. Before you delete and push the tag again, cancel the old
  tag's run if it is still running (or let it finish), and never re-run
  that old run afterwards: it still builds the old commit, and its
  publish job refuses a tag that no longer points at the commit it
  built.

A release that is published is final: `release.yml` never changes or
replaces it (prepare and publish both stop with an error for a tag that
has one), and its tag must never be moved or deleted. Fix a problem in a
published release with a new version.

## 11. Working on the IDE

The IDE is in `ide/` (and eleven libraries in `ide-support/`). Run it
from your clone to work on it (section 7), and read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changing-the-ide) before you change
it.

**Script-only stacks** (`*.livecodescript`) are text. Edit them in the
IDE's script editor or any text editor, keep the file's style, mark
changes to inherited scripts with `-- OXT-Beyond:` comments, and run the
[IDE compile check](#ide-compile-check). Prefer script-only stacks for
new code.

**Binary stacks** (`*.livecode`, `*.rev`, `*.oxtstack`) are stored in Git
byte for byte; Git cannot show what changed inside them. Change the
scripts and properties of their objects with patch files, so that every
change is reviewable text that CI checks:

- write a script or property patch in `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches/`,
  one file per change (the format is in
  [tools/oxt/README.md](tools/oxt/README.md#binary-ide-stacks));
- apply it with `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.sh <development engine>`,
  where the development engine is `LiveCode-Community` of a Linux or
  macOS build (for example from a release's
  `OXT-Beyond-<ver>-linux-x86_64-binaries.tar.xz`). The tool saves the
  patched stacks in `ide/` and verifies that nothing else in them
  changed; patches that are applied already are left alone;
- commit each patch file together with the stack it changes. CI checks
  that every script patch is applied (`tools/ci/check_ide_stacks.py`)
  and the Linux build that every property and image patch is
  (`tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.sh --check` with the engine it built);
- run the IDE compile check, which also compiles the object scripts
  inside binary stacks, and try the change in the installed layout
  (`dist\stage\OXT-Beyond-<ver>\OXT-Beyond.exe`) as well.

A change that a patch cannot express, such as adding or deleting
objects, is made with the IDE built from this repository, running from
your clone, so that the stack is loaded from `ide/` and saved back there
by the engine this project ships. Change only that stack (saving
rewrites the whole file, and can change its format version and the paths
stored in it), commit it on its own, and show what changed with the
diff of the stack's dump before and after
(`tools/oxt/ide-stack-dump.livecodescript`, see
[tools/oxt/README.md](tools/oxt/README.md#binary-ide-stacks)).

The "OpenXTalk Lite" text still inside some binary stacks is meant to be
changed with patches, a few stacks at a time.

**Importing IDE files** from an installed OpenXTalk Lite (or LiveCode)
folder is done with [`tools/oxt/layout.py`](tools/oxt/README.md):
`classify` shows where each installed file belongs, `import` makes the
IDE files in `ide/` and `ide-support/` mirror the installed ones, and
`verify` checks the result. [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) describes how the
OpenXTalk Lite history was imported with it, and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#importing-from-other-projects) the
rules for new imports.

## 12. Building on Linux

The Linux engine is built by the workflow
[`.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`](.github/workflows/build-linux.yml)
in an `ubuntu:20.04` container, for x86_64 on `ubuntu-24.04` runners and
for arm64 on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`. CI takes the image (and the 32-bit
build's `debian:bullseye`) through Google's mirror of Docker Hub,
`mirror.gcr.io/library/...`: the same images, without Docker Hub's pull
limit for GitHub's shared runners. It caches the packages of step 1
(main's builds save them once a month) and, in the package jobs, the
runtime libraries' packages (one entry per runner image). Ubuntu 20.04 is the newest Ubuntu that
still ships Python 2.7, which gyp and `config.py` need, and its glibc
2.31 is the oldest the binaries need. These are the workflow's steps,
written for x86_64 (use `arm64` instead of `x86_64` for the other
build); they have been run in that container only, not on other
distributions or with other compilers.

1. **Tools** (as root in the container):

   ```sh
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
     build-essential gcc g++ make perl bison flex gawk pkg-config \
     python2 python-is-python2 python3 openjdk-11-jdk-headless \
     git curl ca-certificates bzip2 xz-utils zip unzip file binutils \
     libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrender-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev \
     libxv-dev libxcursor-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev \
     libexpat1-dev libgtk2.0-dev libpopt-dev liblcms2-dev
   ```

2. **Prebuilt libraries.** LiveCode's download server no longer serves
   the Linux ones, so they are built from the pinned sources in
   `prebuilt/versions` (the workflow keeps the result in the Actions
   cache): OpenSSL, curl, ICU and CEF (x86_64 only), then the Thirdparty
   set from `thirdparty/`:

   ```sh
   export MODE=release BUILDTYPE=Release PREBUILT_MAKE_JOBS="$(nproc)"
   cd prebuilt
   PREBUILT_BUILD_LIBS="openssl curl icu cef" ./build-libraries.sh linux x86_64
   ./package-libs.sh linux x86_64
   PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1 PREBUILT_LINUX_LIBS="OpenSSL Curl ICU CEF" \
     PREBUILT_BUILD_LIBS=thirdparty ./build-libraries.sh linux x86_64
   ./package-libs.sh linux x86_64
   PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1 ./fetch-libraries.sh linux x86_64
   cd ..
   ```

   (`PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1`: these tarballs were built here, so
   `prebuilt/SHA256SUMS`, which lists published files, has no entries
   for them.)

3. **Configure and build**, with the same `PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR` and
   `PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY` in the environment. The second `make` copies
   the build products into `linux-x86_64-bin`; it runs on its own
   because its input folder is only created while the first one runs:

   ```sh
   export PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/prebuilt/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1
   make config-linux-x86_64
   make -C build-linux-x86_64/livecode LiveCode-all debug-symbols BUILDTYPE=Release -j"$(nproc)"
   make -C build-linux-x86_64/livecode default BUILDTYPE=Release -j"$(nproc)"
   ```

4. **Check.** The workflow checks that the expected files are in
   `linux-x86_64-bin`, that no ELF file needs more than glibc 2.31 and
   the libstdc++ of that system (`tools/ci/check_elf_floor.py`), that
   the server engine runs a script, and compiles the checkout's IDE with
   the new development engine:

   ```sh
   python3 tools/ci/check_elf_floor.py linux-x86_64-bin --machine x86_64 --exclude '*.dbg' \
     --max GLIBC=2.31 --max GLIBCXX=3.4.28 --max CXXABI=1.3.12 --max GCC=7.0.0
   python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py compile --repo-layout --bin linux-x86_64-bin
   ```

   The development engine, `linux-x86_64-bin/LiveCode-Community`, finds
   the IDE of the clone as the Windows one does (repository mode); CI
   runs it that way only headless, for this check.

5. **Package** the x86_64 build as described in
   [Linux package](#linux-package): the workflow uploads
   `linux-x86_64-bin` as two tarballs (the `.dbg` debug files in the
   second; the build's own tools, GENTLE among them, in neither), and
   the job "Package linux-x86_64" makes the package from them on
   `ubuntu-24.04`, whose glibc and OpenSSL 3 load every bundled xTalk
   extension. Linux arm64 is built and checked, but not packaged.

## 13. Building on macOS

The macOS engine is built by the workflow
[`.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`](.github/workflows/build-macos.yml),
natively for each architecture: arm64 on `macos-15`, x86_64 on
`macos-15-intel`. The steps below are the workflow's, for one
architecture (`ARCH` is `arm64` or `x86_64`, the machine's own); they
have been run on those runners only.

1. **Tools:** Xcode 16.4 (`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_16.4.app`)
   with its macOS SDK; a JDK, for its headers only (`JAVA_SDK` names its
   home folder, which has `include/`); Python 2.7.18 first on `PATH` as
   `python` and `python2` (the workflow builds it with `pyenv install
   2.7.18` and links it into a folder of its own), for gyp and
   `config.py`; and Python 3 (the system's), for the checks and
   packaging.

2. **Prebuilt libraries**, built from the pinned sources as on Linux
   (OpenSSL and ICU, then the Thirdparty set; there is no CEF on macOS,
   where revBrowser and the browser widget use the system's WebKit):

   ```sh
   export ARCH=arm64 TARGET_ARCH=arm64 PREBUILT_MAC_ARCHS=arm64
   export XCODE_TARGET_SDK=macosx XCODE_HOST_SDK=macosx MODE=release BUILDTYPE=Release
   export PREBUILT_MAKE_JOBS="$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
   cd prebuilt
   PREBUILT_BUILD_LIBS="openssl icu" ./build-libraries.sh mac universal
   ./package-libs.sh mac universal
   PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1 PREBUILT_MAC_LIBS="OpenSSL ICU" \
     PREBUILT_BUILD_LIBS=thirdparty ./build-libraries.sh mac universal
   ./package-libs.sh mac universal
   PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1 ./fetch-libraries.sh mac
   cd ..
   ```

   (`PREBUILT_MAC_ARCHS` limits the "universal" libraries to this
   machine's architecture.)

3. **Configure and build**, with `PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR` and
   `PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY` set as above:

   ```sh
   export PREBUILT_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/prebuilt/packaged" PREBUILT_SKIP_VERIFY=1
   ./config.sh --platform mac
   xcodebuild -project build-mac/livecode/livecode.xcodeproj -configuration Release \
     -target default -jobs "$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)"
   ```

   The build products are in `_build/mac/Release`, with
   `LiveCode-Community.app` (the development engine) and
   `Standalone-Community.app`.

4. **Check.** The workflow checks the expected files, the architecture
   of the engines and that they link nothing outside the system, that
   every Mach-O file
   records macOS 11.0 (arm64) or 10.13 (x86_64) as its minimum and SDK
   11.0 (`tools/ci/check_macho_floor.py`), that the server engine runs a
   script, and compiles the checkout's IDE with the new development
   engine:

   ```sh
   python3 tools/ci/run_livecode_check.py compile --repo-layout --bin _build/mac/Release
   ```

5. **Package:** the workflow uploads `_build/mac/Release` as two
   tarballs (the `.dSYM` bundles in the second; static libraries and the
   build's own tools, GENTLE among them, in neither), and the job
   "Package mac-universal" joins the two architectures into one
   universal app, as described in [macOS app](#macos-app).

## 14. Building the web engine

HTML5 standalones run the web engine: the standalone engine built with
[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) into WebAssembly, which browsers
run. Most of its code for the web is in `engine/src/em-*.cpp`, and in
`engine/src/em-*.js` the JavaScript for what a browser does its own way
(events, dialogs, files, URLs, sound, the player, the browser widget and
printing), which
[`util/emscripten-javascriptify.py`](util/emscripten-javascriptify.py)
links with the engine. The engine waits with Asyncify: while a handler
waits, the engine saves its WebAssembly stack and hands control back to
the browser, whose events and timers resume it. What a stack can and
cannot do in a browser is in the guide
[Deploying Your Application](ide/Documentation/guides/Deploying%20Your%20Application.md).

A browser loads no libraries, so the externals that the web engine runs,
revXML, revZip, revDB, revDB's SQLite driver and revSpeech (with the
browser's speech synthesis,
[`revspeech/src/emscriptenspeech.cpp`](revspeech/src/emscriptenspeech.cpp)),
are linked into it, and registered by name before it starts
([`engine/src/em-externals.cpp`](engine/src/em-externals.cpp)): the
engine and revDB find them by the names they load them by. Every external
has its own copy of libexternal, so each one is compiled with
[`libexternal/src/external-static.h`](libexternal/src/external-static.h)
(and revDB and its driver with
[`revdb/src/dbdriver-static.h`](revdb/src/dbdriver-static.h)), which
gives the names they would all define a prefix of their own. The SQLite
driver reports SQL errors with C++ exceptions, so it and the SQLite
library are compiled to catch them, and the engine is linked with
exception catching on; the engine's own code is not.

OpenSSL is linked into the web engine too, for `encrypt`, `decrypt` and
`the cipherNames`, rather than loaded as `revsecurity`
([`engine/kernel.gyp`](engine/kernel.gyp)). It is built for the web
without what a browser cannot do and what the engine does not use there
([`prebuilt/scripts/build-openssl.sh`](prebuilt/scripts/build-openssl.sh)),
and the web engine has OpenSSL's ciphers without the sockets that SSL
secures (`MCSSL_CRYPTO` in
[`engine/src/sysdefs.h`](engine/src/sysdefs.h)).

It is built on Linux by
[`tools/ci/build-web.sh`](tools/ci/build-web.sh), which the job "Web" of
every build workflow ([`.github/workflows/web.yml`](.github/workflows/web.yml))
runs in an `ubuntu:22.04` container: the newest Ubuntu that has both the
Python 2.7 that gyp and `config.py` need and a Python 3 new enough for
Emscripten (3.10). These are its steps:

1. **Tools** (as root in the container): the compilers and tools of the
   Linux build, without its libraries, and the Emscripten SDK of the
   version in `config/emscripten-version`:

   ```sh
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
     build-essential gcc g++ make perl bison flex gawk pkg-config \
     python2 python3 git curl ca-certificates bzip2 xz-utils zstd zip unzip file
   ln -sf /usr/bin/python2 /usr/local/bin/python
   version=$(head -n 1 config/emscripten-version)
   git clone --depth 1 --branch "$version" https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git /opt/emsdk
   /opt/emsdk/emsdk install "$version"
   /opt/emsdk/emsdk activate "$version"
   source /opt/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
   ```

   (Ubuntu 22.04 has no `python-is-python2`, so `python` is linked by
   hand. A tag can be moved, so `web.yml` checks that the tag is the
   commit it pins in `EMSDK_COMMIT`; a new Emscripten version needs
   both.)

2. **Build:**

   ```sh
   tools/ci/build-web.sh web-runtime
   ```

   The first run builds the libraries that no server publishes, in
   `prebuilt/`: OpenSSL, ICU and the Thirdparty libraries for the web
   (`prebuilt/lib/emscripten/js`), and ICU, libz and libffi for the
   build's own tools, which run on Linux (`prebuilt/lib/linux/<arch>`;
   libz and libffi in a build folder `build-linux-<arch>` configured for
   nothing else). A later run builds only the engine, and
   `tools/ci/build-web.sh --libraries` only the libraries. The script
   sets `PREBUILT_SKIP_FETCH=1`, because the build would otherwise look
   for archives of those libraries (see [Settings](#settings)), and
   `WEB_JOBS` sets how many jobs make runs at once (by default, one for
   each processor). It writes the web runtime into the folder that it
   is given, which must be new or empty:

   | File | Contents |
   | --- | --- |
   | `standalone-community-<version>.js`, `.wasm` | The engine. `<version>` is `BUILD_SHORT_VERSION` in the file `version` (`9.7.1-OXT`), which is how the IDE's web builder asks for it. |
   | `standalone-community-<version>.html` | The page of a standalone, from `engine/rsrc/emscripten-html-template.html`. |
   | `emscripten-standalone-template/` | The files every standalone gets: the font it draws text with. |
   | `emscripten-startup-template.livecodescript` | The template of a standalone's startup script. |

3. **Check** it with the [web standalone check](#web-standalone-check),
   and run the engine's own tests in it with the
   [web engine tests](#web-engine-tests) (which need a desktop build
   output for its development engine and `lc-compile`):

   ```sh
   python3 tools/ci/web_check.py --runtime web-runtime --engine-cache /tmp/oxt-engine
   python3 tools/ci/web_tests.py --runtime web-runtime --bin linux-x86_64-bin
   ```

4. **Package:** `tools/oxt/package.py` installs the runtime in
   `Runtime/Emscripten/js`, where the installed IDE's web builder
   ([`ide-support/revsaveasemscriptenstandalone.livecodescript`](ide-support/revsaveasemscriptenstandalone.livecodescript))
   takes it from, when `OXT_WEB_RUNTIME` names it (see
   [Package](#package)). Every platform's package gets the same web
   runtime. The IDE run from a clone (repository mode) takes the engine
   and the page from `emscripten-bin` instead, and the templates from
   `engine/rsrc`: to make HTML5 standalones with it, copy the three
   engine files there.

After a change to the engine, the build folder that the script
configured (`make config-emscripten`) builds the engine again by
itself, which compiles only what changed:

```sh
source /opt/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
export PREBUILT_SKIP_FETCH=1
BUILDTYPE=Release emmake make -C build-emscripten/livecode javascriptify -j"$(nproc)"
```

The engine and the page are in `build-emscripten/livecode/out/Release`.

### The web IDE

The web IDE is the IDE run in a web page by the development engine built
for the web ([`tools/web-ide/README.md`](tools/web-ide/README.md) says
what works in it and how it is put together). It is built from an
installed Linux OXT-Beyond, whose Extensions, Dictionary and binary stacks
it takes, with this checkout's script-only stacks over them:

```sh
tools/ci/build-web-ide.sh <installed OXT-Beyond> web-ide-site
```

The script runs `tools/ci/build-web.sh --libraries` first, then builds the
web IDE's engine (the targets `development-web` and
`javascriptify-development` of [`engine/engine.gyp`](engine/engine.gyp),
which the web standalone engine's build does not build), then the site
with [`tools/web-ide/build_site.py`](tools/web-ide/build_site.py). The
site is static files: serve the folder with any web server (for example
`python3 -m http.server` in it) and open its `index.html`.
