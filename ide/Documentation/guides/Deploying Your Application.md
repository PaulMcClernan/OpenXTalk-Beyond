# Deploying Your Application

## Introduction

With XTalk, it is easy to deploy your application to anyone.

Using the standalone building capability you can create a native
application for each operating system you want to support. Users
can run these applications like any other application they download and install.
Standalone applications can have their own identity as true applications, include
icons, document associations and more.

## Building a Standalone Application

When you have finished your application and what to distribute it you can build
it into a standalone application. These applications do not require users to have the IDE.
All of the engine's feature set is available for use in a standalone application, with the
exception that you cannot set scripts on objects.

The builder itself will let you build standalone applications for any platform it supports,
from any platform it supports with the exception that iOS standalones must be
built on Mac OS X. For example you can build a Windows standalone on a Mac OS X
machine. However, you may wish to check that your application looks and behaves correctly
on each platform you intend to support. Please note it is inherently harder to debug an
application that has been built as a standalone, so you should test your application as
thoroughly as possible before building it.

### Step by step

Deploying an app to standalone is straightforward:

1) Open your stack in the IDE

2) Select **File → Standalone Application Settings...** from the menu bar

3) Select the settings for your app

4) Make sure that checkboxes for each platform you wish to build for are checked

5) Close the standalone settings window

6) Select **File → Save as Standalone Application...** from the menu bar

Your application will be packaged up and placed in the selected output folder.

## Standalone Applications Settings

The Standalone Applications Setting dialog allows you to create settings for your
standalone application. This dialog can be found in the File menu. The settings you enter
are applied to the current front most editable stack and are saved with the stack. This
means you only need to enter the settings once for each application you create. The same
settings will apply if you do another build in the future.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mode Selector**       | Choose between the different standalone application settings screens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Standalone Name**     | Set the name of your standalone application. This should be the name you want your finished application to have. Don’t include a file extension (.exe on Windows or .app on Mac OS X) as the standalone builder can create standalones for multiple platforms and will add the appropriate extension automatically. |
| **Inclusions Selector** | Choose the components you want to include in a standalone. You may either choose to search for required inclusions automatically, or manually select the components you want to include.                                                                                                                            |

**Search for Inclusions**

This is the default option. When selected, the IDE will search your application stack file
(main stack and sub stacks) to attempt to determine what components your application uses.
It will then include those items.

**Select Inclusions for the Standalone Applications**

Select this option if you want to specify the components to include manually. You may wish
to use this option if your application dynamically loads components that cannot be searched
at this point automatically, or if you know exactly what components your application uses
and wish to speed up the standalone building process by skipping the automatic search step.

It is important that you choose to include all the components that your application uses
or it may fail. If you do not include your own custom error reporting or the IDE’s
standalone error reporting dialog (discussed below) such failure may be silent – i.e. an
operation in your standalone will simply cease working without displaying anything to the
user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Profiles Settings**                        | Choose between the Property Profile settings options. You only need to alter settings in this area if you have used Property Profiles (see the section on *Property Profiles* in Chapter 4, Builder a User Interface above)                        |
| **Remove all profiles**                      | Removes all profiles and builds the standalone using the currently active profile on each object. Select this option if you don't need to change profile in the standalone and want to save disk space by removing extraneous profile information. |
| **Set all objects to profile**               | Set all objects to a specific profile then remove the profile data from objects.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Include profiles and the profile library** | Include the profile library and allow switching between profiles in the standalone application. You can choose whether to include specific profiles or all profiles.                                                                               |


#### Including Additional Stacks

![](images/standalone-settings-stacks.png)

Figure 2 – Standalone Settings – Stacks Tab

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stack Files**                          | Use this section to add additional stack files to your application. Any stacks you add to this section will be added to the `stackFiles`property of the main stack of your standalone. This means that any scripts within your standalone application will be able to locate and reference these stacks by name. |
| **Advanced Options**                     | Use this section to control exactly how multiple stack files are managed in your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Move substacks into individual files** | If you select this option, each of the sub stacks in the stack files you select will be moved into their own individual file, located in the data folder or within the application bundle of your standalone.                                                                                                   |
| **Rename stackfiles generically**        | Renames each sub stack file using a number on disk (instead of using the name of the sub stack). Select this option if you do not want the names you have selected for stacks to be visible to the end user in the filing system.                                                                               |
| **Create folder for stackfiles**         | Creates a folder and places the stack files into that folder, instead of storing them at the same level as the standalone executable. All references in the `stackFiles`property will refer to this folder using a relative path so the stacks can still be located by the standalone application.               |
| **Individual stack options**             | Select a stack file on the left then an individual stack from within the file to set options on that stack.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Set destroyStack to true**             | Set this option if you want the selected stack file to be removed from memory when it is closed. This option is useful if you are loading large stacks into memory and want them to be removed when they are closed.                                                                                            |
| **Encrypt with password**                | Secures the scripts within the selected stack file with a password. This provides a basic level of encryption that prevents someone from casually reading the scripts in the stack by opening the file in a binary file viewer.                                                                                 |

> **Note:** A stack file directly attached to a standalone application cannot have changes
saved to it. This stack is bound directly to the executable file that runs. The OS locks
an executable file while it is running. If you want to save changes in your standalone
application, split your stack up until multiple files. A common technique is to create a
"splash screen" stack that contains a welcome screen and then loads the stacks that make
up the rest of your application. These stacks are referenced as `stackFiles`on this pane
in the standalone settings screen. It is thus possible to automatically update these
component stacks, or to save changes to them. You may also want to consider creating
preference files in the appropriate location on your end user's system (see the
`specialFolderPath`function and query/setRegistry functions for more information).

> **Note:** Adding additional stacks to the stacks tab is not supported for iOS,
Android or HTML5 standalones. Additional stacks may be included via the Copy
Files tab.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-stack files in the application** | List other files to be included in the standalone. Use this feature to include help documents, read me files and other resources that you want to include with your standalone each time you build.                                                                    |
| **Copy Referenced Files**              | Loops over all image and player objects in stacks and copies any files referenced in the `fileName`property of these objects into the standalone. Then automatically sets the `fileName`property to reference these files in the standalone using referenced file paths. |
| **Destination folder**                 | Create a subfolder within your standalone to copy the image and movie files to.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Including Additional Resources

![](images/standalone-settings-inclusions.png)

Figure 4 – Standalone Settings – Inclusions

The list of resources available to select for inclusion in a standalone
application are a combination of currently installed Builder
extensions, externals and database drivers (both built-in and those
found in user folders), and built-in resources and script libraries.

The following built-in resources are available by default:

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ask Dialog**       | This option is required if any of your scripts use the "ask" or "ask password" commands. The standalone builder will copy the stack "ask dialog" from the IDE into your standalone as a sub stack. The standalone builder makes a copy of your stack before adding resources to it as part of the build process, so your original stack is unaltered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Answer Dialog**    | This option is required if any of your scripts use the "answer" command. Note that this only applies to the dialog form of the command. The answer file / printer / color / effect / folder / page setup / printer and record forms of the command do *not* require this option. The standalone builder will copy the stack "answer dialog" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Browser**   	   | This option is required if your application uses the embedded browser or any `revBrowser` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Browser (CEF)**    | This option is required if your application uses the embedded CEF browser or any `revBrowser` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Brushes**          | This option is required if your application uses any brush cursors. It is not required if your application does not make use of the painting commands. It copies the stack "brushes" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Cursors**          | This option is required if your application uses any cursors. It is not required if your application only uses OS cursors. It copies the stack "cursors" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Database**         | This option is required if your application uses database access or any `revDatabase` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Magnify**		   | This option is required if your application uses the magnify palette.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **PDF Printer**      | This option is required if your application uses the "open printing to pdf" command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Print Dialog**     | This option is required if your application uses the built-in print or page setup dialogs (e.g. for use on Linux without GTK installed). It is not required if you only display the system printer and page setup dialogs. It copies the stack "print dialog" and "page setup" into your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **SSL & Encryption** | This option is required if your application uses any SSL or encryption related commands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **XML**              | This option is required if your application uses any `revXML` commands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Build for Mac OS X 32-bit**                                   | Build a standalone that includes a 32 bit slice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Build for Mac OS X 64-bit**                                   | Build a standalone that includes a 64 bit slice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Application Icon**                                            | Choose an application icon to represent the application in the Finder. The icon should be in icns format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Document Icon**                                               | Choose a document icon to represent your application's documents in the Finder.

| **Icons for ask / answer dialogs**                              | Choose an icon to display whenever you use the ask or answer commands to display a dialog. On Mac OS X, the convention is that these dialogs should display your application icon. The icon should be stored in your stack as an image, or selected from built-in icons. If you have used a built-in icon, be sure to select the relevant inclusion on the General tab (if you are selecting inclusions manually). |
| **PLIST – enter information and have the IDE write the PLIST** | Have the IDE fill out the PLIST for your application automatically. The PLIST is a settings file stored in XML format stored as part of every Mac OS X application. It contains information about the application, including its name, version number, copyright notice and document associations. Having the IDE create this file for you is the recommended option. For more information about PLISTs consult [Apple's developer documentation](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/plist.5.html)|
| **Choose a file to import into the application bundle**         | Choose to import a PLIST file instead of having the IDE create one. Select this option if you have created your own highly customized PLIST that you want to use for your application in each build you create.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Short version / long version**                                | The version information to be included with your standalone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Almost every Internet-connected device has a web browser.  If your application
can run in a browser, your app can be used anywhere and by anyone, without any
need to download or install it.

An HTML5 standalone runs your stacks in a page of a web site, with
OXT-Beyond's web engine: the engine built as WebAssembly, which browsers
run. The **Web** pane of the Standalone Application Settings builds one:
tick **Build for HTML5**, and set the page's title, icon, colour and the
place of the main stack in it if you like. To try the standalone, choose
**Development → Test Target → _a browser_** from the menu bar, then
**Development → Test** (or the **Test** button of the toolbar): the IDE
builds the standalone, serves it from a web server on your own computer,
and opens it in that browser. On Linux, the menu lists whichever of
Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium and Microsoft Edge are installed.

##### Supported browsers

The engine needs one of these browsers, or a newer version:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or Microsoft Edge 85
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) 79
* Safari 15, on macOS, iOS and iPadOS

OXT-Beyond's own tests run the standalones in Chromium.

##### Contents of the HTML5 standalone

The HTML5 standalone is a folder of four files (five with an icon), which
a web site serves together:

* `<name>.html`, the page, named after the standalone (the **General**
pane), with the **Title** of the **Web** pane as its title (or, without
one, the stack's label or name) and the pane's other settings. It says
"Loading..." until the engine starts, then shows the main stack.
* `icon.<extension>`, the page's icon, a copy of the image that the
**Icon** setting names.
* `standalone-community-<version>.js` and
`standalone-community-<version>.wasm`, the engine. They are the same for
every standalone made with the same version of OXT-Beyond.
* `standalone.zip`, your application: the stacks, the extensions and
script libraries they use, the files of the **Copy Files** pane, and the
font that the engine draws text with.

A browser runs the page only from a web server (an `http://` or `https://`
address), not from a file on the disk. Any web server will do. If it sends
the `.wasm` file with the type `application/wasm`, as most do, the browser
starts compiling the engine while it downloads; otherwise it waits for the
whole file. To try a standalone on your own computer without the IDE, run
a web server in its folder (for example `python3 -m http.server`) and open
`http://localhost:8000/<name>.html`.

##### What a stack can do in a browser

The web engine is the desktop engine, so stacks look and behave as they do
on the desktop: cards, groups, controls and graphics, the message path,
behaviors, script libraries, Builder extensions and widgets. Stacks other
than the main stack open in their own windows in the page, each with a
title bar that shows the stack's title, as on the desktop: the user moves
a window by its title bar, resizes a resizable stack by its right and
bottom edges (within its `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight` and
`maxHeight`), and closes it with the close box, which sends
`closeStackRequest` first. A click brings a window to the front, palettes
stay above the other stacks (unless `the raisePalettes` is false), dialogs
above those, and menus above all. As on Linux, a window has no title bar
when its `decorations` leave out the title or give it a shape, and `the
effective rect` of a stack includes its title bar. A stack's `blendLevel`
makes its window see-through, and a stack whose `ignoreMouseEvents` is true
lets the mouse through its window to what is under it. The main stack's
window is the page itself, with no title bar. A page can restyle the title bars:
their class names start with `oxt-window`. A modal dialog (`modal`, or a
stack opened as a dialog) keeps the mouse and the keys from the stacks
under it until it closes, and then the keyboard goes back where it was,
as on the desktop. Where a browser does things its own way:

* **The look.** A browser has no look of its own for a stack's controls,
so the engine draws them all itself, as the desktop engines draw a part
that the system does not: in the `Windows 95` look and feel, in the
colours of Windows' light theme (light grey stacks and buttons, white
fields, a blue selection), whatever system the browser runs on and
whichever colour scheme it is set to: `the systemAppearance` is `light`.
Data grids work as they do on the desktop.
* **Waiting.** `wait`, `wait until` and `wait with messages` work in any
handler, and the page goes on running while the engine waits. The
exception is a handler that the page's JavaScript calls (see
**JavaScript** below): the page is waiting for its answer, so it cannot
wait in turn, and a `wait` there throws an error, which `try` can catch.
* **Dialogs.** `answer`, `ask`, `ask password` and `answer color` show
dialogs in the page, which wait for the user, and give `it` and `the
result` as on the desktop. In a handler that the page calls, the browser's
own dialogs are used instead. A page can restyle the dialogs: their class
names start with `oxt-dialog`.
* **Files.** The file commands and functions (`open file`, `read`, `write`,
`file:` and `binfile:` URLs, `the files`, `create folder` and the rest)
work on the engine's own file system, which is in the page, not on the
user's disk:
  * `specialFolderPath("resources")` is `/boot/standalone`, where the files
of the **Copy Files** pane are, and is the `defaultFolder` when the
standalone starts.
  * `specialFolderPath("home")` is `/livecode`, with the `documents`,
`desktop`, `preferences` and `support` folders in it. The browser keeps
this folder for the web site, so what a stack writes there is still there
on the user's next visit, in the same browser. (A page can turn this off;
see **The Module object** below.)
  * `specialFolderPath("temporary")` is `/tmp`. It, and every folder but
the home folder, starts afresh on each visit.
  * `answer file`, `answer files` and `answer folder` show the browser's
file picker. The files that the user picks are copied into `/uploads`
(`specialFolderPath("uploads")`), and `it` has the copies' paths.
  * `ask file` gives a path in `/downloads` (`specialFolderPath("downloads")`).
A file written there goes to the user as a download when it is closed.
* **URLs.** `get url`, `put ... into url`, `post`, `load url` and the
Internet library's commands use the browser's own requests. A browser
lets a page read from its own web site, and from other sites only when
they allow it (with CORS headers); a request that the browser refuses
fails as one to a server that cannot be reached.
* **Links.** `launch url` opens an `http` or `https` address in a new tab,
and gives a `mailto:` or `tel:` link to the application that answers it;
it refuses `javascript:` and `data:` addresses. `launch document` opens a
file of the engine's file system in a tab. A browser opens a tab only just
after the user has clicked or typed, so at other times the page asks the
user first.
* **Keyboard, mouse and touch.** Keys, modifier keys (Cmd is the command
key on a Mac), the mouse, its wheel and the standard cursors work as on
the desktop, and the copy, cut and paste keys use the system clipboard.
`the mouse`, `the mouseLoc` and `the mouseClick` follow the page's
events, also in a loop that asks for them without waiting (`repeat while
the mouse is down`), as on the desktop. On a touch screen, a finger on a
stack is the mouse: touching presses the mouse button, moving moves the
mouse, and lifting lets the button go, so taps click and fingers drag.
The touch screen's keyboard comes up while an
unlocked field has the focus, as on a phone: when the touch that put the
focus there ends (a browser brings it up only for a touch), or the next
touch after a script did, and it goes away when the field loses the
focus. What it types reaches the field as keys, with their `keyDown`
messages, and so does text from dictation or an emoji picker. Text that
a keyboard composes before it sends it (an input method for Chinese,
Japanese or Korean, or a phone's keyboard that sends a word at a time)
reaches the field with no `keyDown` messages.
* **Drag and drop** between the controls and stacks of the page works as
on the desktop: `dragStart`, `the dragData`, `dragEnter`, `dragMove`,
`dragLeave`, `dragDrop` and `dragEnd`, `the dragImage` and the engine's
own dragging of text between fields. The cursor says what a drop would
do, and Escape cancels a drag. A drag that a stack starts stays in the
page. Files, folders, text and HTML dragged from another application or
page can be dropped on a stack. The browser shows what such a drag
carries only when it is dropped, so the stack under the pointer gets
`dragEnter`, `dragMove` and `dragDrop` then (or `dragLeave`, if it does
not take the drop), and until then the pointer says that a drop would
copy. The files and folders are copied into `/uploads`, as those that
`answer file` gives are, and `the dragData["files"]` has their copies'
paths.
* **The screen** is the browser's window: `the screenRect` is its size, a
stack gets `desktopChanged` when it changes, and stacks draw at the
screen's scale, so they stay sharp on high-resolution screens and when the
page is zoomed. `import snapshot` and `export snapshot` of the screen or of
a stack's window take what the stacks show there, and `the mouseColor` is
the colour under the mouse; the rest of the page, and the pages of the
browser widget and movies of the player, which a page cannot read, are the
page's background colour. With no rectangle, the user drags one out on the
page, or clicks a stack to take its window, as on the desktop; Escape
cancels, and the import fails.
* **Sound.** `play` plays audio clips and WAV, AU and AIFF files, and
`beep` beeps. A browser lets a page make sound only once the user has
clicked or typed in it: until then, a sound waits, and one that ends
before then is not heard, although the stack is told that it played.
* **The player** plays the movies and sounds that the browser can play
(MP4, WebM and MP3 in current browsers), from the engine's file system or
an address, with the browser's own controller. Its `timeScale` is 1000. A
browser starts a movie with sound only once the user has clicked or typed
in the page; a movie whose `playLoudness` is 0 starts at once.
* **The browser widget** shows a page of the stack's own web site, its
`htmlText`, or a file of the engine's file system, with its messages, `do
... in widget` and the page's calls to its `javascriptHandlers`, as on the
desktop. It shows a page of another web site only if that site lets other
sites show its pages; the engine then knows only the address it gave the
widget, `do ... in widget` does nothing, and the page calls a handler with
`window.parent.postMessage({liveCode: "handlerName", parameters: [1, 2]}, "*")`.
In Safari, a page of the stack's own site gets its `liveCode` object only
once it has loaded, so a script that calls a handler as the page loads
should wait until `window.liveCode` is there.
* **Builder extensions and widgets** work, including foreign handlers with
callbacks. A native library built for a desktop system cannot be loaded.
* **XML, zip archives and databases.** revXML (with XSLT), revZip and
revDB with its SQLite driver work as on the desktop, on the files of the
engine's file system. Include them as on the desktop, on the
**Inclusions** pane or by letting the builder search for them. A database
in the home folder is kept between visits, as any file there is.
* **Encryption.** `encrypt` and `decrypt`, with a cipher or with RSA
keys, and `the cipherNames` work as on the desktop: the engine has OpenSSL
in it, so the **SSL & Encryption** inclusion is not needed. It has every
cipher of the desktop engines but the four `aes-...-cbc-hmac-sha...`
ones, which need an x86 processor's AES instructions. `md5Digest`,
`sha1Digest`, `messageDigest` and `randomBytes` work too.
* **Speech.** revSpeech speaks with the browser's speech synthesis, and
the voices of the system the browser runs on: `revSpeak`,
`revStopSpeech`, `revIsSpeaking()`, `revSpeechVoices()`,
`revSetSpeechVoice`, `revSetSpeechSpeed`, `revSetSpeechPitch` and
`revSetSpeechVolume`, on the scales they have on Windows, and `revSpeak`
stops what is being said first, as on a Mac. Include it as on the
desktop. A browser speaks only once the user has clicked or typed in the
page, as it plays sound, and it does not tell a voice's gender:
`revSpeechVoices("male")` and `revSpeechVoices("female")` list the
voices whose names say so.
* **Printing.** `open printing`, `print`, `print break`, `cancel
printing` and `close printing` work, with the page settings (`the
printPaperSize`, `the printPaperOrientation`, `the printMargins`, `the
printPaperScale` and the layout properties) as on the desktop. When
printing closes, the browser's print dialog opens with the pages, and the
user prints them or saves them as a PDF there: a browser does not let a
page print without it, so `answer printer` and `answer page setup` return
at once, as if OK was clicked, and the number of copies, collation and
two-sided printing are chosen in the dialog. The paper is US Letter or A4,
as the browser's language has it, and `the printerName` is empty. Each
page is a picture of it at 300 dots an inch, so the text of a PDF of it
cannot be searched or copied. `open printing to pdf`, and `the
printerOutput` set to `file:` and a path, write a PDF of the pages'
pictures, with the links, anchors and bookmarks of `print link`, `print
anchor` and `print bookmark` and the document information of `with
options`. A PDF written into `/downloads` reaches the user as a download.
* **JavaScript.** `do <script> as "JavaScript"` runs JavaScript in the
page, and `the result` is its value. The page calls the handlers that a
stack's `cJavascriptHandlers` property lists, one handler name a line:
`document.liveCode.findStackWithName("My Stack").myHandler(1, 2)` returns
what the handler returns. Builder extensions call JavaScript with the
`com.livecode.emscripten` module.
* **Fonts.** Text is drawn with Droid Sans, plain or bold, which every
standalone has, with the Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters of Droid
Sans Fallback (bold text in those draws plain, as it has no bold).
Font files listed one by one on the **Copy Files** pane (not in a folder)
are loaded when the standalone starts, and their fonts are used by name.
`start using font file` loads a font file of the engine's file system
(one in a folder of the **Copy Files** pane, or one that the stack
downloaded or wrote) until `stop using font file`, as on the desktop;
`globally` makes no difference, because the page is the only place that
the font is used.

##### What a stack cannot do in a browser

A browser does not let a page do some of what a desktop application does,
and some features are not done yet. They fail as they do on a desktop that
cannot do them:

* Sockets: `open socket` puts "not supported" into `the result`, and
`accept` does nothing. Use URLs to talk to servers.
* Other programs: `shell()` throws an error, and `open process` does
nothing.
* Externals other than revXML, revZip, revDB and revSpeech, so neither
revBrowser (the browser widget works) nor the video grabber; and revDB's
drivers other than SQLite, because MySQL, PostgreSQL and ODBC talk to
their servers through sockets. The builder warns about each one that a
stack includes. Builder extensions work.
* Dragging out of the page: a drag that a stack starts cannot be dropped
on another application.
* Window shapes, minimizing and maximizing: a stack's `windowShape` takes
its window's title bar away but leaves the window a rectangle, and a title
bar has only a close box, so the user cannot minimize or maximize a
window. Setting `the iconic` of a stack changes nothing in the page.
* `the systemVersion` and `the machine` are empty, and `the processor` is
`js`; `the platform` is `HTML5`. To know the browser, ask it:
`do "navigator.userAgent" as "JavaScript"`.

##### Advanced: HTML5 standalone filesystem

When the engine starts, it unpacks `standalone.zip` into its file system,
from its root:

* `/boot/__startup.data`: the stacks, extensions and startup script.
* `/boot/standalone/`: the files of the **Copy Files** pane, and the fonts
that text is drawn with (`DroidSansCombined.ttf`, and
`DroidSansCombined-Bold.ttf` for bold text). Both are the font family
"Droid Sans"; a font that the standalone has not got draws in it, plain or
bold as asked.

Files that you add to the archive yourself are unpacked too, at their paths
in it; put them outside `boot/`.

##### Advanced: Embedding an HTML5 standalone in a web page

The page that the builder writes is a plain one, with the settings of the
**Web** pane. To put the standalone in a page of your own, the page needs
three things: a canvas, a JavaScript `Module` object, and the engine's
script.

##### The canvas

The engine draws the main stack in an HTML5 `<canvas>` element inside a
`<div>` element:

* neither may have a border or padding, or the mouse will be off by as
much
* the engine sets their size to the stack's, so don't set it with HTML or
CSS
* the canvas should be the only element in the div, where the engine adds
the elements of widgets and players
* the canvas needs an id, so that the page can give it to the engine

The smallest canvas is:

    <div><canvas id="canvas" style="border: 0 none; padding: 0; outline: none;" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault();"></canvas></div>

`outline: none` hides the outline that most browsers draw around the
element that has the keyboard focus.

##### The Module object

The top-level JavaScript `Module` object tells the engine how to run. It
needs only the canvas:

    <script>
      var Module = {
        canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
      };
    </script>

These are the other things that it can have:

* `print` and `printErr`: functions that get each line that the stack
writes to stdout and stderr (`write ... to stdout`). Without them, the
lines go to the browser's console.
* `setStatus`: a function that gets "Running..." as the engine starts, and
empty text once it has started.
* `livecodeStandalone`: the name of the standalone archive (by default
`standalone.zip`).
* `livecodeStandalonePrefixURL`: put before that name to make the
archive's address, for an archive in another folder or on another site.
* `locateFile`: a function that takes the name of a file that the engine
needs (its `.wasm` file, and the archive) and returns its address. When
it is there, `livecodeStandalonePrefixURL` is not used.
* `livecodeStandaloneRequest`: a request for the archive that the page has
already started, so that the archive downloads while the engine's script
does: an `XMLHttpRequest` whose `responseType` is `"arraybuffer"`. The
engine starts once it has arrived.
* `livecodePersistent`: `false` to start the home folder afresh on every
visit, instead of keeping it in the browser.

See also Emscripten's
[Module object documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/module.html).

##### Engine download

The engine's script loads the engine's `.wasm` file from its own folder,
and the archive from the page's folder. The browser downloads it while the
rest of the page loads:

    <script async src="standalone-community-<version>.js"></script>

Make sure to replace `<version>` with the version in the engine's file
names.

##### Bringing it all together

Here's a complete page for an HTML5 standalone:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <body>
        <div>
          <canvas id="canvas" style="border: 0 none; padding: 0; outline: none;" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()"></canvas>
        </div>
        <script>
          var Module = { canvas: document.getElementById('canvas') };
        </script>
        <script async src="standalone-community-9.7.1-OXT.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

##### Advanced: Speeding up engine download

The engine's `.wasm` file is about 23 MB, and the archive about 8 MB (the
two fonts are most of it). Web servers can send them compressed, which
browsers unpack as they arrive: compressed with gzip, the engine is about
8.3 MB and the archive about 3.9 MB. Most hosting compresses by itself; on a server of
your own, turn compression on for `.wasm`, `.js` and `.zip` files, or
compress them once with `gzip` and have the server send those files:

* For the Apache web server, configure `mod_deflate` to serve [pre-compressed content](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_deflate.html#precompressed)
* For the NGINX web server, add [`gzip_static on;`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html)
to your configuration.
