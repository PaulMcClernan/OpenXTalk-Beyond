OXT-Beyond is a free, open source development environment for Windows,
macOS and Linux in which you build programs with an English-like
scripting language in the HyperCard/HyperTalk tradition ("xTalk"). You
lay out stacks of cards with buttons, fields and other controls, and
write scripts that respond to what the user does.

OXT-Beyond continues **OpenXTalk Lite**. OpenXTalk Lite was (to my understanding) initiated by
**Terry Little** (TerryL) in September 2023 as a debranded LiveCode
Community 9.6.3, and was built and maintained by **Tom Perry**
(tperry2x) from version 0.91 (September 2023) to version 1.15 (June
2026), for macOS, Linux and Windows, with contributions from **Paul
McClernan** (OpenXTalkPaul) and other members of the
[OpenXTalk community](https://www.openxtalk.org). In August and
September 2026 Tom said that 1.15 is probably as far as he will take OpenXTalk
Lite on the LiveCode 9 engine, that his new OXTL7 (built on a LiveCode 7
engine) is meant to replace it, and that anyone may carry 1.15 on as
their own fork. OXT-Beyond is one such continuation, on the 9.x engine.
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) tells the story
up to OXT-Beyond 0.0.1, version by version; the notes of each release
since are on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases),
and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists every change made since Tom
Perry's last commit, release by release.

Like OpenXTalk Lite, OXT-Beyond is based on **LiveCode Community**, the
GPLv3 edition of LiveCode by LiveCode Ltd and its contributors. The
upstream LiveCode Community repositories have had no changes since July
2021 and are now archived (read-only).

This repository, **OpenXTalk-Beyond**, holds all of it: the engine source (LiveCode Community 9.7 plus
Tom Perry's 9.7.1-OXT engine work), the OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 IDE with
its history, and the scripts that build, package and test OXT-Beyond
for Windows, macOS and Linux. It is maintained by
[SethMorrowSoftware](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware). GitHub
forwards the old name's addresses, so existing clones and links keep
working; `git remote set-url origin
https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond.git` points a
clone at the new one.

## Status

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4 "Frankenstein" is an early release of a young project,
for Windows, macOS and Linux (see what 0.2.1 adds, what 0.2.2 fixes,
what 0.2.3 adds and what 0.2.4 changes, under [The IDE](#the-ide)).
Please read this before you download it. 0.2.4 adds a package for 64-bit
ARM Linux (new in 0.2.4-rc.2). It goes back to Tom Perry's dark mode,
with his macOS work added (see
[0.2.4-rc.4](#024-rc4-tom-perrys-dark-mode-and-macos-work)), brings back
LiveCode's Dictionary (see [0.2.4-rc.5](#024-rc5-livecodes-dictionary)),
and fixes bugs that notes in the inherited code pointed to (see
[0.2.4-rc.6](#024-rc6-fixes-from-the-inherited-notes)) and more found
since (see [0.2.4-rc.7](#024-rc7-more-engine-and-library-fixes)). Two of
those fixes change what existing scripts see: an error in a `try`
statement's `catch` part is now reported, and serial ports on macOS and
Linux are in raw mode.

- **Windows, macOS and Linux.** From 0.1.0 on, every release has
  packages for 64-bit Windows, for macOS (one universal app for Apple
  Silicon and Intel Macs, see [macOS](#macos)) and for 64-bit x86 Linux
  (see [Linux](#linux-x86-64)), made and tested together from one tag
  (0.0.1 and 0.0.2 were for Windows only). From 0.2.4-rc.2 on there is
  a package for 64-bit ARM Linux too (a Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5 on a
  64-bit system; see [Linux (64-bit ARM)](#linux-64-bit-arm)), without
  the browser widget. 32-bit Windows and Linux are built in CI but not
  packaged, for their standalone runtimes.
- **The Android runtime is still a prebuilt one.** Each package's
  engine, externals and tools are built from this repository (Windows
  x86-64, macOS for Apple Silicon and Intel, Linux x86-64), and so are
  the standalone runtimes that every package carries for Windows
  (x86-64 and x86) and Linux (x86-64 and x86): CI builds the 32-bit
  engines for them, and a release asset (`oxt-runtimes-0.2.4-rc.7.zip`)
  brings each platform's runtimes into the other packages. The Android
  runtime, though, is still OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's (stock LiveCode 9.6.3
  builds as Tom Perry shipped them), carried over unchanged in that
  asset. Only the macOS package has the macOS runtimes, there are no iOS
  runtimes (so the Standalone Settings have no iOS card, and a stack set
  to build for iOS in LiveCode builds for its other platforms), and
  32-bit Linux standalones have no browser (CEF's 32-bit
  Linux builds ended with CEF 101). A Linux standalone uses the system's
  libraries, as LiveCode's do (OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's Linux runtimes came
  with copies of some). The automatic tests build a standalone from every
  runtime a package carries, Android aside, and run those the test
  machine can run.
- **Some old third-party libraries.** OpenSSL (3.5.9, a long-term
  support release), curl (8.22.0) and ICU (78.3) are current, built from
  source for every platform, and so are the image and pattern libraries
  the engine compiles in (zlib 1.3.2, libpng 1.6.59, giflib 5.2.2,
  libjpeg 9f, and PCRE 8.45, the last release of PCRE 1). The browser
  widget and revBrowser still use
  CEF 74 (Chromium 74, from 2019), and several libraries in
  `thirdparty/` (libxml2, libxslt, libzip, cairo and the database client
  libraries among them) are years old; they
  have known vulnerabilities, and upgrading them is planned. See
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Not code-signed or notarized.** On Windows, SmartScreen may warn
  about the installer and the program. The macOS app is signed ad hoc,
  not with an Apple Developer ID, and not notarized, so macOS blocks it
  until you allow it once (see [macOS](#macos)). Check downloads against
  `SHA256SUMS`.
- **The installer is new.** The Inno Setup installer first ships with
  0.0.1. CI installs and uninstalls it on every build, but it has had
  little use on real computers yet.
- **Branding is not finished.** The text parts of the IDE (window title,
  About text, menus and dialogs built by scripts) say OXT-Beyond, but
  some windows, dialogs and guides stored in binary stacks still say
  "OpenXTalk Lite"; they will be changed in a later release. The files in
  the build output folder are still named after LiveCode
  (`LiveCode-Community.exe`); packages and the installer rename the
  development engine to `OXT-Beyond.exe`.
- **Some OpenXTalk Lite files are not included.** OpenXTalk Lite shipped
  the mergExt externals (`Ext/`: blur, mergJSON, mergMarkdown,
  mergMicrophone), Apple's Human Interface Guidelines PDF and
  `animationEngine6.zip`. OXT-Beyond does not redistribute them; see
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#files-openxtalk-lite-shipped-that-oxt-beyond-does-not).
- **Mostly separate settings.** OXT-Beyond keeps its preferences, caches
  and logs in its own folders (`%APPDATA%\OXT-Beyond`,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OXT-Beyond`) and does not copy LiveCode's or OpenXTalk
  Lite's settings: the first start uses default preferences. A few
  things are still shared with OpenXTalk Lite or LiveCode: dictionary
  favourites and notes, custom script editor colours, recent-stack
  thumbnails and the engine's licence file (see
  [Where OXT-Beyond keeps your files](#where-oxt-beyond-keeps-your-files)).
- **Tested automatically, but only in part.** Every Windows CI build
  checks that the programs and libraries exist and are genuine x86-64 PE
  images with the expected versions, runs a headless smoke test of the
  engine in the portable zip and in an installed copy (the script engine,
  Unicode, OpenSSL, SQLite 3.51.1 through revDB, revXML and revZip), compiles
  every script of the IDE and compares the errors with a list of known
  ones, builds a standalone from each runtime in the portable zip and
  runs the Windows ones, and installs and uninstalls the installer (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#7-run-check-and-package-the-result)). The
  macOS and Linux packages get the same smoke test (with every bundled
  xTalk Suite extension), IDE compile check and standalone check on
  their own systems, from the disk image on an Apple Silicon and an
  Intel Mac and from the extracted tarball on Ubuntu 24.04, plus a
  signature check (macOS), and library checks and the install scripts
  (Linux). The 32-bit Windows and Linux builds, made for their
  standalone runtimes, get the smoke test, the engine tests and the
  standalone check too. Every build on all three platforms also runs the
  engine tests that LiveCode Community keeps in `tests/` (about 1,150:
  LiveCode Script, LiveCode Builder, the LiveCode Builder compiler and
  the script parser)
  and compares the failures with a list of known ones (see
  [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#engine-tests)). CI also checks that the
  patches of the IDE's binary stacks are applied (see
  [Continuous integration](BUILDING.md#9-continuous-integration)). Every
  build also opens the IDE's own windows one by one, with the system
  light and dark, and
  takes screenshots of them; a step that fails, or a script error, fails
  the build (see [IDE screenshots](BUILDING.md#ide-screenshots)). The
  newest of each platform from `main` are on the
  [`ide-screenshots`](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/tree/ide-screenshots)
  branch. The Linux package has been tried by hand on Kubuntu 24.04, and
  the macOS package not yet.
- **Mac and Linux parts of the IDE.** Tom Perry's IDE also contains
  parts for macOS and Linux only. They are shipped as they were; apart
  from the IDE compile check they are not tested automatically.
- **Legacy build toolchain.** Building on Windows needs the Visual
  Studio 2017 C++ toolset (v141, installed through Visual Studio 2022),
  Python 2.7 and Cygwin; the Linux build runs in an Ubuntu 20.04
  container and the macOS build uses Xcode 16.4, both with Python 2.7.
  See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Download

Releases are published on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases).
From 0.1.0 on, each release has these files for all three platforms
(0.0.1 and 0.0.2 have the Windows files only); `<version>` is the
version, for example `0.1.0`:

| Platform | File | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10 or later, 64-bit (x64) | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-setup.exe` | The installer. Use this unless you have a reason not to. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-portable.zip` | The same program folder without an installer. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-binaries.zip` | Only the built engine, externals and tools (`win-x86_64-bin`, without debug symbols) and the licence files, for use with a source checkout. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-symbols.zip` | Debug symbols (`.pdb`), for developers. |
| macOS 11 or later on Apple Silicon, 10.13 or later on Intel | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` | A disk image with `OXT-Beyond.app`, one app for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, to drag to Applications (see [macOS](#macos)). |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.zip` | The same app, for scripted installs. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal-binaries.tar.xz` | Only the built engine, externals and tools (`Release/`, both architectures joined), without debug symbols and the build's own tools, and the licence files. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal-symbols.zip` | Debug symbols (`.dSYM`), for developers. |
| Linux x86-64 with glibc 2.31 or later | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz` | The program folder, with a launcher and `install.sh` for a per-user install (see [Linux](#linux-x86-64)). |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64-binaries.tar.xz` | Only the built engine, externals and tools (`linux-x86_64-bin`), without debug symbols and the build's own tools, and the licence files. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64-symbols.tar.xz` | Debug symbols (`.dbg`), for developers. |
| 64-bit ARM Linux with glibc 2.31 or later (from 0.2.4-rc.2) | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.xz` | The same program folder for 64-bit ARM, such as a Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5 on a 64-bit system, without the browser widget (see [Linux (64-bit ARM)](#linux-64-bit-arm)). |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-arm64-binaries.tar.xz` | Only the built engine, externals and tools (`linux-arm64-bin`), as for x86-64. |
| | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-arm64-symbols.tar.xz` | Debug symbols (`.dbg`), for developers. |
| All | `OXT-Beyond-<version>-xtalk-sources.zip` | Every file of the bundled xTalk Suite extensions as the release took it from their repositories, so that it can be rebuilt without them. |
| All | `SHA256SUMS` | SHA-256 checksums of all the files above. |

Some bundled xTalk Suite extensions need a newer system than the IDE:
macOS 15 on a Mac, and on Linux glibc 2.33 (SodiumXT) or glibc 2.38 and
OpenSSL 3 (DataChannelXT); see [macOS](#macos) and
[Linux](#linux-x86-64). The release notes list each platform's
requirements too.

Releases whose tags do not start with `v`, such as `prebuilts-v1`,
`runtimes-1.15` and `runtimes-0.2.4-rc.7`, are not programs. They hold
files that the build and the packager download: the prebuilt
third-party libraries of earlier versions and the standalone runtimes
for other platforms.

**Latest development build.** Every successful run of a build workflow
uploads the same files as an artifact: open the workflow, pick a
successful run and download the artifact under *Artifacts*.

| Platform | Workflow | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | [Build (Windows)](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions/workflows/build-windows.yml) | `OXT-Beyond-win-x86_64` |
| macOS | [Build (macOS)](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml) | `OXT-Beyond-mac-universal` |
| Linux | [Build (Linux)](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions/workflows/build-linux.yml) | `OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64`, `OXT-Beyond-linux-arm64` |

You need to be signed in to GitHub to download artifacts, and they are
deleted after 30 days. These builds pass the automatic checks, but
nobody has tried them by hand. They have no xTalk sources zip, and
their build number is the time they were built.

## Quick start

On Windows, use the installer or the portable zip (below). For macOS and
Linux, see [macOS](#macos) and [Linux](#linux-x86-64).

To check a download, compare its SHA-256 with the line for it in
`SHA256SUMS`. On Windows, in Command Prompt, for example:

```bat
certutil -hashfile OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-setup.exe SHA256
```

On macOS, in Terminal, compare the output of

```sh
shasum -a 256 OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg
```

with its line. On Linux, in the folder with the download and
`SHA256SUMS`, this checks every file of the list that is there:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

### With the installer

1. Run `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-setup.exe`.
2. Choose whether to install for all users (into `C:\Program Files\OXT-Beyond`;
   this needs administrator rights) or only for you (into
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OXT-Beyond`; no administrator rights needed).
3. Accept the licence (the GNU GPL version 3) and pick the options: a
   desktop shortcut, and whether `.oxtstack` and `.oxtscript` files should
   open with OXT-Beyond. OXT-Beyond does not take over `.livecode`,
   `.rev` or `.livecodescript` files: the installer does not associate
   them, and the IDE does not offer to (OpenXTalk Lite's "File
   Associations" dialog is not shown on Windows).
4. Start OXT-Beyond from the Start menu.

To remove it, use *Settings > Apps* or "Uninstall OXT-Beyond" in the
Start menu. The uninstaller removes the program but keeps your
preferences. Installing a newer version over an older one replaces it.

The installer is made with Inno Setup and accepts its usual
[command-line options](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline),
for example `/CURRENTUSER /VERYSILENT` for a silent install for the
current user.

### Portable

1. Extract `OXT-Beyond-<version>-win-x86_64-portable.zip` somewhere you
   can write to, such as your Documents folder (not `C:\Program Files`):
   the dictionary writes its index files into the program folder. You
   get one folder, `OXT-Beyond-<version>`.
2. Run `OXT-Beyond.exe` inside that folder.

Keep the folders inside `OXT-Beyond-<version>` together; the program
finds the IDE, externals and runtimes by their places next to
`OXT-Beyond.exe`. The portable copy does not associate any file types
with itself; open stacks from the IDE, or with *Open with* in
Explorer.

### macOS

OXT-Beyond for macOS is one universal app, `OXT-Beyond.app`, for Apple
Silicon and Intel Macs, in `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` (a
disk image) and `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.zip` (the same app,
for scripted installs). Releases carry them from 0.1.0 on (see
[Download](#download)); the latest development build is the artifact
`OXT-Beyond-mac-universal` of a successful run of the
[Build (macOS) workflow](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions/workflows/build-macos.yml).

**Requirements.** The IDE runs on macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later on an
Intel Mac and macOS 11 Big Sur or later on Apple Silicon. The bundled
xTalk Suite extensions (SodiumXT, TorrentXT, enetxt, DataChannelXT,
Box2Dxt and CoinXT, whose native libraries are built for macOS 15) need
macOS 15 Sequoia or later: on older macOS the IDE starts, but those
extensions do not load.

**Install.**

1. Check the download if you like: in Terminal, compare the output of
   `shasum -a 256 OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` with the line
   for that file in `SHA256SUMS`.
2. Open `OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` and drag
   **OXT-Beyond** onto the **Applications** folder next to it. Eject the
   disk image. (From the zip: double-click it, or run
   `ditto -x -k OXT-Beyond-<version>-mac-universal.zip /Applications`.)
3. Start OXT-Beyond from Applications. The first time, macOS blocks it.

**Opening it for the first time (Gatekeeper).** OXT-Beyond is signed
*ad hoc*: it is not signed with an Apple Developer ID and not notarized
by Apple, so macOS will not open a downloaded copy until you allow it.
You do this once. On macOS 15 Sequoia and later:

1. Double-click OXT-Beyond. macOS says that it was not opened, because
   Apple could not verify it is free of malware. Click **Done** (not
   *Move to Trash*).
2. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and scroll down to
   *Security*. Next to "OXT-Beyond was blocked to protect your Mac",
   click **Open Anyway**.
3. Confirm with **Open Anyway** and your password (or Touch ID).

macOS 15 no longer offers *Open* when you Control-click the app, so use
these steps (on macOS 13 and 14, Control-click the app in Finder, choose
*Open* and then *Open* again; on macOS 12 and earlier, the button is in
*System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General*). Or, in Terminal,
remove the quarantine flag that the browser set on the download:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OXT-Beyond.app
```

The same command helps if macOS says the app "is damaged and can't be
opened": that is how some macOS versions report an app that is not
notarized. After this, OXT-Beyond opens like any other app. It opens
`.oxtstack` and `.oxtscript` files; LiveCode's `.livecode`, `.rev` and
`.livecodescript` files it opens too, but it does not take them over from
an installed LiveCode.

To remove OXT-Beyond, move `OXT-Beyond.app` to the Trash.

**Limitations on macOS** (besides those
[for every platform](#known-limitations-and-plans)):

- The app is ad hoc signed and not notarized, hence the steps above.
  Developer ID signing and notarization are planned.
- The IDE still writes a few files into its own program folder (the
  dictionary's index files), which on macOS is inside `OXT-Beyond.app`,
  after the app was signed. Moving them to your user folders is planned.
- Mac standalones: the standalone builder's Intel target builds x86_64
  apps; its Apple Silicon target (*MacOS-IntelArmUniversal* in the
  standalone settings) builds arm64-only apps and needs macOS 14 Sonoma
  or later on the Mac that builds them. Universal standalones are
  planned. Standalones run on macOS 10.13 or later (Intel) and 11 or
  later (Apple Silicon); one that includes an xTalk Suite extension needs
  macOS 15.
- The macOS package does not include the Visual C++ runtime DLLs that
  the Windows packages put next to enetxt and Box2Dxt: a Windows
  standalone built on a Mac with either of them needs the Visual C++
  Redistributable on the PC it runs on. It has no Windows x86-64
  standalone runtime either.
- The macOS packages are built and tested automatically (on macOS 15, on
  both an Apple Silicon and an Intel runner) but have not been tried by
  hand yet.

### Linux (x86-64)

The Linux package is `OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz`.
Releases carry it from 0.1.0 on (see [Download](#download)). It is also
built and tested by every run of the
[Build (Linux) workflow](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/actions/workflows/build-linux.yml)
(artifact `OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64`, with the binaries and symbols
tarballs and `SHA256SUMS`). Check it with
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`.

What it needs:

- **64-bit x86 Linux with glibc 2.31 or newer** (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11,
  Fedora 32 or later) and an X11 desktop; on Wayland it runs through
  XWayland, which the usual desktops start by themselves. The IDE uses
  GTK 2, as LiveCode and OpenXTalk Lite did: on Debian and Ubuntu
  `sudo apt install libgtk2.0-0` (`libgtk2.0-0t64` on Ubuntu 24.04 and
  Debian 13), on Fedora `sudo dnf install gtk2`. The launcher checks for
  every library the engine needs and names the missing ones with their
  packages, instead of the engine ending without a word.
- **The browser widget and revBrowser** (CEF 74) also need NSS, ALSA and a
  few more X11 libraries (the `browser` lines of `linux/libraries.txt` in
  the package). Without them the launcher turns the browser off
  (`LIVECODE_USE_CEF=0`), says which ones are missing, and the IDE shows
  the dictionary and other web pages in your web browser instead, and
  leaves the browser widget out of the Tools palette.
- **Some bundled xTalk extensions need a newer system than the IDE.**
  SodiumXT needs glibc 2.33 (Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 12, Fedora 34 or
  later); DataChannelXT needs glibc 2.38 and OpenSSL 3 (Ubuntu 24.04,
  Debian 13, Fedora 39 or later). On an older system these extensions do
  not load; the IDE and the other extensions work.
- **The player** runs `/usr/bin/mplayer`: on Debian and Ubuntu
  `sudo apt install mplayer`. Without it, players open no file, and the
  Tools palette has no Player tool. mplayer draws only the video: the
  controller below it (`showController`) is drawn by OXT-Beyond, with a
  play/pause button and a well to seek in, but no volume, step or
  selection buttons as on Windows and macOS. A click in the well of an
  MP4 file goes to the key frame before that time, as mplayer seeks.

Either one can be turned on or off in Preferences > Compatibility ("Disable
the Browser widget", "Disable the Player tool"); the IDE sets them when it
first starts, from what it finds, and a change takes effect when it starts
again. The browser widget is in the Widgets section of the Tools palette,
which is hidden at first on every platform: the arrow at the palette's top
right shows it.

To run it where you extract it:

```sh
tar -xJf OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
cd OXT-Beyond-<version>
./oxt-beyond
```

Extract it onto a Linux file system (ext4, Btrfs, XFS and so on, not
FAT, exFAT or a Windows drive): the tarball holds Unix file modes,
symbolic links and hard links. Keep it out of folders named `_build` or
ending in `-bin`, which make the engine look for a source checkout above
it. `oxt-beyond` is the launcher; `OXT-Beyond` is the engine itself,
which starts without the library check. `OXT_BEYOND_SKIP_LIBRARY_CHECK=1`
skips the check.

To install it for yourself, with a menu entry (under Development),
icons, the `.oxtstack` and `.oxtscript` file types and the command
`oxt-beyond`:

```sh
./install.sh
```

It copies the folder to `~/.local/share/oxt-beyond` (or
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/oxt-beyond`), links `~/.local/bin/oxt-beyond` to the
launcher, and needs no administrator rights; it refuses to run as root
or with `sudo`. The extracted folder can be deleted afterwards. Running
a newer package's `install.sh` replaces the installed copy.
`~/.local/share/oxt-beyond/uninstall.sh` removes exactly what
`install.sh` added (it keeps a list in the installed folder). Like the
Windows installer, it leaves `.livecode`, `.livecodescript` and `.rev`
files alone, and OpenXTalk Lite's Linux "file associations" dialog is
not shown. Your preferences, caches and logs are in `~/.oxt-beyond`;
uninstalling keeps them.

The Linux package does not include the Visual C++ runtime DLLs that the
Windows packages put next to enetxt and Box2Dxt: a Windows standalone
built on Linux with either of them needs the Visual C++ Redistributable
on the PC it runs on.

### Linux (64-bit ARM)

From 0.2.4-rc.2 on, releases also carry
`OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.xz`, for 64-bit ARM Linux: a
Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5 running a 64-bit system (Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit,
Ubuntu) or an ARM server. It is experimental. It is the same program
folder as the x86-64 package, built natively on GitHub's ARM machines
and put through the same checks there (the IDE starts, a standalone is
built and run, the player plays, the bundled xTalk Suite extensions
load), and it is installed and run the same way (see
[Linux (x86-64)](#linux-x86-64)). It needs the same libraries, glibc
2.31 or later and a 64-bit system: a 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS cannot run
it.

What it does not have:

- **No browser widget and no revBrowser.** They use CEF 74, which has no
  Linux ARM build, so the package leaves them out, the IDE opens web
  pages in your web browser, and the Tools palette has no browser widget.
- **Standalones for 64-bit ARM Linux are built only by this package**,
  from its own runtime ("Linux arm64" in the standalone settings). The
  other packages carry no arm64 runtime, so they do not offer it.
- **No Raspberry Pi has run it in CI**: the checks run on GitHub's ARM
  servers, under a virtual screen.

### Where OXT-Beyond keeps your files

On Windows:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Preferences (`oxt-beyond7.rev`) | `%APPDATA%\OXT-Beyond\Preferences` |
| Cache, crash logs, documentation cache and IDE logs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OXT-Beyond\` (`Cache`, `Crash Logs`, `Documentation Cache`, `Logs`) |
| Script copies for an external script editor (if you turn that option on) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OXT-Beyond\Cache\IDEScriptEdits` |
| Your own extensions and plugins | `Documents\OXT-Beyond extensions`, unless you choose another folder in Preferences |

On macOS:

- Preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/OXT-Beyond`
- Cache, crash logs and documentation cache:
  `~/Library/Application Support/OXT-Beyond/` (`Cache`, `Crash Logs`,
  `Documentation Cache`); the script copies for an external script
  editor are in `Cache/IDEScriptEdits`
- IDE logs: `~/Library/Logs/OXT-Beyond/`
- Your own extensions and plugins: `~/Documents/OXT-Beyond extensions`,
  unless you choose another folder in Preferences

On Linux:

- Preferences, cache, crash logs, documentation cache and IDE logs:
  `~/.oxt-beyond/` (`preferences`, `cache`, `crashlogs`,
  `documentationcache`, `logs`); the script copies for an external
  script editor are in `cache/IDEScriptEdits`
- Your own extensions and plugins: `~/OXT-Beyond_extensions`, unless you
  choose another folder in Preferences

Installed and portable copies of OXT-Beyond on the same computer share
these folders. LiveCode and OpenXTalk Lite keep their preferences
elsewhere (on Windows `%APPDATA%\RunRev` and `%APPDATA%\xtalk`), so
OXT-Beyond can be installed next to them.

Some files are still kept in the same places as OpenXTalk Lite or
LiveCode, because binary stacks or the engine, which this release does
not change, read or write them there. The table gives the Windows
locations; macOS and Linux use their own equivalents:

| What | Where | Shared with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dictionary favourites and notes | `%APPDATA%\xtalk\xTalkDictionary` | OpenXTalk Lite |
| Custom script editor colours | `%APPDATA%\xtalk\Preferences\customScriptColours.dat`, once you customize them | OpenXTalk Lite |
| Thumbnails of recent stacks | `Documents\OXTRecentStacks` | OpenXTalk Lite |
| The engine's Community licence file, written by the engine when it starts | `%APPDATA%\RunRev\Licenses\livecode-community-9_7_1-OXT-25923.lclk` | LiveCode's folder; OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 writes the same file (same engine version) |

A change made in one of these programs, such as a dictionary favourite,
shows up in the others. Moving them to OXT-Beyond's own folders is
planned (see [Known limitations and plans](#known-limitations-and-plans)).

### Updates

*Help > Check for Updates* asks GitHub for the latest OXT-Beyond release.
If it is newer than yours, OXT-Beyond shows an excerpt of its release
notes and a button that opens the release page in your browser; you
download and install the new version yourself. OXT-Beyond never
downloads or installs anything by itself and never asks for
administrator rights to update. An automatic check (at most once a day)
can be turned on in *Preferences > Automatic Updates*; it is off by
default. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#updates).

## What is in it

### The IDE

The IDE is OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's, with its history back to Terry Little's
first release (see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)). Compared with the
LiveCode Community 9.6.3 IDE it started from, it has, among other
things:

- light and dark appearance (with the engine's Windows dark mode), dark
  icon sets for the tools palette, an orange accent colour, more script
  editor colour schemes and customisable script editor colours;
- a draggable menubar, a tools palette in sections (with more shapes,
  rebuilt paint tools and an optional eight-column layout) and many new
  keyboard shortcuts;
- `.oxtstack` and `.oxtscript` as the default file types (the
  `.livecode` and `.livecodescript` types still open);
- a stack-based dictionary with a plain-text export, favourites and
  notes, *Help > Dictionary Online*, the "All Guides" stack, Terry
  Little's User Guide and Data Grid Guide (PDF), lessons, examples and
  demo stacks (*Help > Demos*);
- the Quick Dictionary, Report Builder and App Browser plugins, Axwald's
  Message Watcher, a Card Navigator, *Edit > Replicate*, optional
  alignment guides while dragging objects, and tool snippets (sample
  scripts for new objects);
- preferences to switch off the data grid, the Player tool and the
  browser widget, a prompt to name new stacks, a gallery of recent
  stacks, lock/unlock of all objects and a "remove effects" command;
- the Calendar and Pie Chart widgets.

OXT-Beyond 0.0.1 adds:

- the OXT-Beyond name, About text and credits, splash screen and icon
  (adapted from Tom Perry's OpenXTalk Lite icon);
- its own preference, cache, log and extension folders (see above);
- an update check against this repository's GitHub Releases that only
  notifies (OpenXTalk Lite's own updater, which downloaded files from
  Tom Perry's servers and installed them with administrator rights, is
  no longer used);
- a Windows installer and a portable zip in the installed layout, with
  the standalone runtimes for other platforms.

OXT-Beyond 0.0.2 adds:

- the [xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions), built in and
  taken from their own repositories at pinned versions;
- a fix so that an extension you install yourself is loaded instead of
  a built-in copy of the same extension (which copy won used to be
  random);
- from Tom Perry's macOS work: guards against a crash when a menu sends
  a key press to a closed stack and against recursive menu bar updates,
  and "semibold" as a text style name (the same as "demibold");
- behind the scenes, the same engine building for Linux and macOS in
  CI, on the way to packages for those platforms.

OXT-Beyond 0.1.0 adds:

- packages for macOS and Linux, made and tested together with the
  Windows ones from one tag: one universal `OXT-Beyond.app` for Apple
  Silicon and Intel Macs (a disk image and a zip, signed ad hoc, see
  [macOS](#macos)) and a portable Linux x86-64 package with a launcher
  and a per-user install script (see [Linux](#linux-x86-64));
- readable text in the Windows dark mode: disabled labels (toolbar,
  buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, tabs) are drawn once in a flat
  grey instead of an engraved double image, scrollbars are dark and
  follow a switch between light and dark, and the IDE's lists, Extension
  Manager, Tools palette and toolbar icons have dark colours, partly
  adapted from HyperXTalk (see [Credits](#credits));
- two light mode colours restored that OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 had changed
  by mistake (white text on selected list rows and on coloured badges);
- a fix for a crash of the Linux engine when it opens a stack whose
  text font is "(System)" without a display.

OXT-Beyond 0.2.0 adds:

- stacks that stay readable in the dark appearance: where a stack sets
  some colours but not others (a white field with no text colour, say, or
  a checkbox on a light card), the unset colours now fit the ones the
  author set, so a stack designed light looks as designed, and only a
  stack that sets no colours at all is drawn dark;
- the engine properties `appAppearance` (the application's appearance:
  "light", the default, "dark" or "system") and `stackAppearance` (one
  stack's), with their `effective` forms, in the dictionary. Standalones
  are light unless they set the `appAppearance`; standalones built with
  OpenXTalk Lite 1.14 or later or OXT-Beyond 0.1.0 followed the dark mode
  of Windows and macOS, and do so again after
  `set the appAppearance to "system"` (on macOS from 10.14 on);
- the Windows native controls drawn dark in the dark appearance
  (checkboxes, radio buttons, tabs, field and group frames, sliders,
  progress bars, option menus and combo boxes), dark title bars per
  window, and the light appearance whenever a High Contrast theme is on;
- the macOS native controls drawn dark in the dark appearance (push
  buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, option menus, combo boxes, little
  arrows, tabs, field and group frames, scrollbars, sliders and progress
  bars), by the engine itself, since the classic macOS theme only draws
  them light (experimental);
- printing always in the light appearance, and a fix for a crash when a
  snapshot of the screen was taken on Windows;
- about 40 fixes from HyperXTalk (see
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#code-adapted-from-hyperxtalk)),
  among them painted images kept when the card changes, no crash exporting
  a widget, script editor hangs on "/*" and on binary data in a tree
  view, the macOS backdrop and custom cursors, Linux dialog leaks and
  typing lag, localized Desktop and Documents folders on Linux, File >
  Open with a missing folder, file dates after 2038, and `pop` with
  nothing pushed;

and in the IDE:

- a light IDE on every system, dark ones included, with the appearance
  as a choice: *View > Appearance* (and *Preferences > Appearance*) sets
  the IDE's appearance (**Light**, the default; **Dark**; **Follow the
  System**) and, separately, that of your own stacks (**Light, like a
  standalone**, the default; **Dark**; **Follow the System**; **Same as
  the IDE**). A change shows at once in every palette. The choices need
  the engine's new appearance properties. Dark mode is for Windows and
  macOS: on Linux the appearance follows the GTK theme, so there the items
  are shown but disabled;
- your stacks looking in the IDE as they will in a standalone. A
  standalone is light unless its stack asks for the system's appearance,
  with one line in its `startup` or `preOpenStack` handler:
  `set the appAppearance to "system"` (or `"dark"`);
- the menubar as a standard window on a new install (and in a profile
  that has no setting yet); a profile that already stores the docked
  menubar keeps it, and *Preferences > Appearance > Show the toolbar as a
  standard Window* switches it;
- a dark script editor (One Dark Pro by default, adapted from HyperXTalk,
  with Tom Perry's schemes still in the menu; the editor keeps separate
  light and dark colours in *Preferences > Script Editor*, the custom
  scheme's included, and a dark scheme and background chosen in an
  earlier version become the dark appearance's too, while the light
  appearance keeps them), and a
  readable Inspector, Message Box, error dialog, Find and Replace,
  Standalone Application Settings, Menu Builder and dictionary code
  examples in the dark appearance;
- light mode fixes for colours OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 saved into the
  Extension Manager, Extension Builder, Search, the icon chooser and the
  warning shown before opening a stack with scripts, and blue links in
  About, the User Guides and the dictionary instead of OpenXTalk Lite's
  yellow (a profile that still has the yellow default gets the blue one;
  a colour you chose yourself stays);
- *View > Show IDE Stacks In Lists* in one click (from HyperXTalk).

OXT-Beyond 0.2.1 "Frankenstein" (its release candidates were 0.2.1-rc.1
to 0.2.1-rc.7) adds:

- LiveCode Community's engine test suites, about 1,150 tests of LiveCode
  Script, LiveCode Builder, the LiveCode Builder compiler and the script
  parser, on every build of all three platforms, compared with lists of
  known failures (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#engine-tests));
- fixes for engine bugs that those tests and the compiler's warnings
  found. On Windows: creating a player in a stack that has no window (for
  example without a user interface, `-ui`) no longer crashes; output
  redirected to a file or a pipe (`standalone.exe > log.txt`, or `shell()`
  from another program) reaches it again; without a user interface,
  `accept connections` listens again and `wait` no longer keeps a
  processor busy; dates before 1970 convert; file paths that a script
  puts on the clipboard are native; the `playLoudness` of a player and
  the player properties that the Windows player cannot get (the duration
  and current time of a file it cannot play, for example) no longer
  return random values; the `fontNames` no longer fail for no reason;
  and without a user interface (`-ui`) the engine no longer reads past
  the end of its screen object for the theme font, which now and then
  crashed the 32-bit engine at startup, or for the device context it
  measures fonts and draws themed controls with (new in 0.2.1-rc.3);
- on Linux and macOS, `~` is `$HOME`, and on Linux `~user/folder`
  resolves; on Linux the last second of 1969 converts, and file lists on
  the clipboard and in drag and drop keep names with spaces and "+"; on
  macOS, Java support finds Java 9 and later, on Apple Silicon an
  Objective-C exception in a method that LiveCode Builder calls is an LCB
  error again instead of ending the program, and without a user interface
  (`-ui`) socket events are handled at once instead of at the next timer,
  so libURL's requests no longer take until their 60-second timeout
  (new in 0.2.1-rc.2); and on Linux the player plays files: it had sent
  its commands to mplayer without ending them, so mplayer ignored them,
  and a paused player no longer moves on a frame each time a script reads one
  of its properties, in the IDE and in the Linux standalones that every
  package builds (new in 0.2.1-rc.4);
- in the IDE on Linux, the Player tool and the browser widget are on where
  they can work (with mplayer, and with the libraries the browser needs),
  instead of off as OpenXTalk Lite left them, and the Player tool creates
  a player again (new in 0.2.1-rc.5);
- on Linux a player shows its controller (`showController`), with a
  play/pause button and a well to seek in: mplayer draws only the video,
  and OpenXTalk Lite's player had no controller at all; and the engine no
  longer hangs now and then when a movie ends, and a shell command's exit
  status is no longer lost while a player is open, in the IDE and in the
  Linux standalones that every package builds (new in 0.2.1-rc.6);
- on every platform: text compares by codepoint however the engine holds
  it (on Windows and macOS, `sort ... text` and `<` on text with chars
  such as the euro sign or curly quotes depended on how the string had
  been made); a pressed button's hilite follows the pointer again
  instead of flickering; exporting a widget whose kind is not loaded no
  longer crashes; LiveCode Builder's base conversion no longer crashes
  for a base below 2; and the `constraints` of a player (QTVR, which no
  current player supports) are zeros instead of random numbers;
- one change in behaviour: `baseConvert` (and LiveCode Builder's
  `converted from base`) of a number above 4,294,967,295 is an error
  instead of a wrong, wrapped-around result;
- the repository's new address,
  [github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond)
  (it was `winoxt`), in the update check, the About box and the
  installer (new in 0.2.1-rc.2). 0.2.0 and 0.2.1-rc.1 still find updates
  through GitHub's redirect from the old address;
- current versions of three libraries that had reached their end of
  life, built from source for every platform, Windows included (new in
  0.2.1-rc.3): OpenSSL 3.5.9 instead of 1.1.1 (secure sockets, `encrypt`
  and the database drivers' encryption), ICU 78.3 instead of 58.2
  (Unicode 17 instead of 9: text comparison, sorting, case and break
  rules) and, for the server engine, curl 8.22.0 instead of 7.51.0.
  `encrypt` and the `cipherNames` still offer the older ciphers (Blowfish,
  DES, RC4 and others), from OpenSSL's legacy provider. Secure
  connections now need TLS 1.2 or later, and keys of at least 2048 bits
  (RSA) in the certificates: OpenSSL 3's default security level refuses
  less, which also ends the old MySQL driver's encrypted connections
  (it speaks TLS 1.0 only). The macOS server engine follows HTTP
  redirects again (a version check skipped them with the system's
  curl 8);
- current versions of the image and pattern libraries that the engine
  compiles in (new in 0.2.1-rc.3): zlib 1.3.2 instead of 1.2.8, libpng
  1.6.59 instead of 1.6.26, giflib 5.2.2 instead of 5.1.4, libjpeg 9f
  instead of 9b and PCRE 8.45 (the last release of PCRE 1) instead of
  8.39, which fix their published vulnerabilities in reading
  compressed data, images and regular expressions;
- standalone runtimes built from this repository in every package (new
  in 0.2.1-rc.3), for Windows (x86-64 and x86) and Linux (x86-64 and
  x86), in place of OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's: the macOS and Linux packages
  can build Windows x86-64 standalones now, and Linux standalones built
  with the Windows and macOS packages get their externals and database
  drivers and a 64-bit `revsecurity` and `revpdfprinter` (1.15's 64-bit
  Linux runtime had no externals list and 32-bit copies of those two).
  Every package's tests build a standalone from each runtime it carries;
- a check of the browser widget, revBrowser and the player in a
  standalone on every build of all three platforms (new in 0.2.1-rc.4;
  see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#browser-and-player-check));
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), which lists every change made since Tom
  Perry's last commit, release by release (new in 0.2.1-rc.4);
- the "Frankenstein" artwork of 0.2.1: a new OXT-Beyond icon (an orange
  "OXT" struck by lightning, over a stitched seam) for the app on Windows,
  macOS and Linux, the About box and the dialogs, and a friendly
  flat-topped monster on the splash screens and the Windows installer.
  The About box names the release "Frankenstein" (new in 0.2.1-rc.7).

OXT-Beyond 0.2.2 fixes a crash of 0.2.1: on macOS 14 and 15 the IDE quit
just after its splash screen, on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs alike.
macOS adds submenus of its own to the Edit menu (AutoFill, Writing
Tools), and the engine took them for its own menus. Every macOS build
now also starts the IDE and fails if it is not still running after 90
seconds (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)).

OXT-Beyond 0.2.3 adds dark mode on macOS (experimental). From macOS 10.14
on, stacks follow the `appAppearance` and `stackAppearance` as they do on
Windows, and the IDE's appearance choices (*View > Appearance* and
*Preferences > Appearance*) work on the Mac. The classic macOS theme only
draws its native controls light, so the engine draws the controls of a
dark stack itself, in macOS's dark colours with the Mac's accent colour.
The IDE and your stacks stay light unless you choose otherwise. 0.2.3
also fixes *Preferences > Appearance*, where the appearance menus and
their note covered the window's bottom row and part of the Reset button
([#51](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/issues/51)).

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4 is what its seven release candidates, 0.2.4-rc.1 to
0.2.4-rc.7, were; nothing in the program changed after 0.2.4-rc.7. What
each of them changed follows, in order.

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.1, a test release, fixes bugs reported on 0.2.3:

- macOS: a script that changes what is on screen at every statement (a
  stack that fills and clears dozens of fields while a card opens, for
  example) no longer freezes the IDE. Each such update used to wait for
  the Mac to draw, about 50 ms a time; the screen now catches up with the
  script instead.
- Linux: the browser widget always shows its page, no longer keeps the
  keyboard after a page loads (typing into the message box or another
  stack works again), and clicking a stack takes the keyboard back from
  it.
- Linux: with a dark GTK theme the engine reports the `systemAppearance`
  as `"dark"`, so the IDE draws its dark palettes. *View > Appearance*
  shows "Follow the System" there.
- The text dictionary works when the install's folder cannot be written
  (the Mac app run from its disk image or by a user who is not an
  administrator, or a Linux install owned by root): it used to open empty
  and stop responding. The Quick Dictionary's auto-search finds entries
  again instead of reporting a database error.

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.2, a second test release, adds a package for 64-bit
ARM Linux (a Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5 on a 64-bit system, or an ARM
server), experimental and without the browser widget (see
[Linux (64-bit ARM)](#linux-64-bit-arm)). The bundled xTalk Suite
extensions carry 64-bit ARM Linux libraries for it, and the standalone
builder offers "Linux arm64" in that package. Everything else is
0.2.4-rc.1's.

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.3, a third test release, fixes how the IDE looks,
in the light and the dark appearance, on Windows, macOS and Linux:

- Tooltips over anything drawn dark are dark grey with white text; they
  were white, or pale yellow on Linux, behind white text.
- A stack opened in the dark appearance keeps all its controls. Any
  stack with a tree view widget in a group lost some (the Script Editor
  opened with 62 of its 101), and saving it then would have lost them
  for good.
- The dark Tools palette, Project Browser, Inspector, Standalone
  Settings, icon chooser and the Script Editor's search results no
  longer have dark shapes, icons or text on their dark background, and
  on macOS the default and pressed buttons of dark dialogs have white
  labels.
- The dictionary shows the bullets and accented characters of its
  entries (each showed as two or three wrong characters), links each of
  its links whole (about 1,700 of its 5,900 were underlined on the
  wrong letters or missing), and draws them in a light blue in the dark
  appearance.
- Linux: fields and scrollbars no longer have red frames and troughs
  under the Adwaita theme on X servers with a DirectColor visual (Xvfb
  and many Xorg setups).
- Windows: a focused list field no longer draws a stray line where the
  last text cursor was (for example in Preferences); standalones get
  this fix too.
- Script errors in the Inspector, Preferences and Standalone Settings
  are gone, and so are smaller faults: the names in *Preferences >
  Debug Properties* were black on dark blue, the Standalone Settings
  title kept the previous card's name on its Mac and Android cards, and
  the Message Box showed "97,97,97" in its results.
- iOS standalones cannot be built with the open source version, so the
  Standalone Settings have no iOS card any more, and a stack set to
  build for iOS builds for its other platforms.

These fixes were checked in CI (the builds, their tests and screenshots
of the IDE's windows in both appearances on every platform), not yet by
people using the IDE, so please report anything that looks or works
wrong (see
[Getting help and reporting problems](#getting-help-and-reporting-problems)).

#### 0.2.4-rc.4: Tom Perry's dark mode and macOS work

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.4, a fourth test release, takes out OXT-Beyond's own
dark mode work and goes back to Tom Perry's, so that Beyond builds on his
OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 as he left it. Our dark mode carries on in a
separate, experimental repository.

Taken out (all added from 0.1.0 to 0.2.4-rc.3):

- the `appAppearance` and `stackAppearance` properties, *View >
  Appearance* and *Preferences > Appearance*. The IDE and your stacks
  follow the system's appearance again, as in OpenXTalk Lite 1.15. A
  stack that sets either property now gets a script error there;
- the dark controls the engine drew itself on Windows and macOS, the
  dark colours it fitted to a stack's own, dark tooltips, the dark GTK
  theme on Linux, and the dark colours, icons and script editor schemes
  added to the IDE.

What you get instead:

- Windows: Tom Perry's dark mode, as in OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 (dark title
  bars and system colours, dark checkmarks and arrows). Its readability
  problems that 0.1.0 fixed (engraved disabled labels, light scrollbars)
  are back.
- macOS: Tom Perry's macOS engine work, new in OXT-Beyond: dark mode
  that follows the Mac, with buttons, menus, scrollbars, progress bars,
  sliders, tabs and group boxes drawn by AppKit; the `macSetIcon` command
  and function, which set a file's Finder icon; screen updates that no
  longer wait for the Mac to draw each one; and his changes to how some
  controls behave on the Mac: a radio button with autoHilite turns off on
  a second click, a scrollbar is hidden when the content fits and the
  field wraps into the space, and button labels are drawn 2 pixels
  higher. His developer commands `_internal dump stack` and
  `_internal build MacARM` are in the macOS IDE too.
- Every platform: `matchText`, `matchChunk` and `replaceText` follow the
  `caseSensitive` (false by default), as Tom Perry's shipped 1.15 engines
  do. LiveCode always matched case.
- Linux: light only, until Tom Perry's Linux 1.15 source is merged.

Kept: every fix that is not dark mode, among them the Windows snapshot
crash fix (in Tom Perry's dark mode code), the light colours OpenXTalk
Lite 1.15 had saved into some IDE stacks, the macOS freeze and crash
fixes, the dictionary fixes and the Linux packages.

None of Tom Perry's macOS work has been tried on a Mac by the people
working on OXT-Beyond yet, only built and tested in CI. Please report
what looks or works wrong.

#### 0.2.4-rc.5: LiveCode's Dictionary

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.5, a fifth test release, brings back LiveCode's
Dictionary as *Help > Dictionary*: every entry of the language, up to
the newest syntax, and the entries of the extensions and widgets that
OXT-Beyond installs (the tree view, header bar, calendar and pie chart
widgets among them), with its guides beside it. Tom Perry's text
dictionary is still there: choose it in *Preferences > Dictionary*
("Use Dictionary stack instead of a browser instance"). The first start
of 0.2.4-rc.5 switches *Help > Dictionary* to LiveCode's Dictionary
once, whichever one you used before.

- The dictionary, its guides and the text dictionary are made from
  their sources in every build, as LiveCode's were, instead of from
  copies kept by hand, so they say the same, and a fix to an entry
  reaches all three.
- The guides list each guide once (eight were listed twice), without
  LiveCode's build instructions and its 9.0 release notes.
- Linux: the dictionary and the guides open in the IDE, as on Windows
  and macOS; they opened in your web browser even where the browser
  widget works. The 64-bit ARM package, which has no browser widget,
  still opens them in your web browser.
- The dictionary names its languages xTalk Script and xTalk Builder,
  and five glossary entries that only the text dictionary had (MIDI,
  OpenXION, playSentence, soundFont, soundbank) are in both.

#### 0.2.4-rc.6: fixes from the inherited notes

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.6, a sixth test release, fixes bugs that FIXME and
TODO notes in the code inherited from LiveCode pointed to (the notes
are listed in [LEGACY-TODO.md](LEGACY-TODO.md)):

- `play videoClip` with a URL, or with the clip's data, plays again; it
  always failed with "error writing videoClip".
- Linux: `toUpper`, `toLower` and `sort ... international` use your
  locale (from LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE or LANG), as on Windows and macOS;
  they always used US English.
- Linux: `ask file` and `answer file` honor `with filter`, written as on
  Windows. `*.jpg` also finds `PHOTO.JPG`, and `*.*` shows every file.
- macOS: a player sizes its movie from the video track as the track is
  meant to be shown, so a portrait phone video is portrait.
- Windows: `open process` no longer stops checking the other processes
  when one that has ended still has output to read.
- `messageDigest` with a type it doesn't know is an error that names
  that type.
- revPDFPrinter draws quadratic curves, and a print that fails or is
  cancelled no longer leaves a partial PDF behind.
- Widgets and libraries: the canvas takes its documented fill rule
  "non-zero" (only "non zero" worked); file saves from xTalk Builder
  work across drives on Windows and report errors on macOS and Linux;
  comparing numbers no longer overflows.
- Windows: the installer removes an older version's dictionary data
  before it installs, so an update shows no stale entries.

The standalone runtimes for the other platforms in each package are
built again for this release, so standalones for Windows and Linux get
these fixes too.

#### 0.2.4-rc.7: more engine and library fixes

OXT-Beyond 0.2.4-rc.7, a seventh test release, fixes more bugs found in
the code inherited from LiveCode. Two of them change what existing
scripts see, so they come first:

- `try`: an error in the `catch` part, or in the `finally` part, is
  thrown to the caller instead of being dropped, and `finally` still
  runs after an error in `catch`. A script with a failing statement in
  a `catch` part used to carry on silently and will now report the
  error. A `try` whose try part is empty still runs `finally`, and
  `exit`, `return`, `pass`, `exit repeat` and `next repeat` inside
  `finally` work; they were ignored.
- macOS and Linux: serial ports (`open driver`) are set to raw mode, so
  data arrives as the device sends it. Scripts that relied on the old
  CR to LF translation will see the raw bytes. Data bits other than 8
  and even parity after an odd setting work, Linux ports can receive,
  and a port that can't take its settings fails to open.
- `repeat for each element` over a numbered array visits every element
  (keys like 1, 2.5 and 3 no longer pass for a list), and `repeat for
  each key` over a list goes in number order. `repeat for each line`
  (or item, word...) over empty text leaves the loop variable as it was.
- `intersect` with a threshold counts pixels exactly at the threshold,
  so "opaque pixels" finds hits against a solid object, and the answer
  no longer depends on the order of the two objects.
- Multipart form posts (`libURLMultipartFormData`) pass the strict
  checks of web servers that use the OWASP rules: the boundary is no
  longer quoted, and file parts carry no Content-Transfer-Encoding
  header.
- The httpd library reads large POSTs in full, answers "Expect:
  100-continue", adds no stray bytes, and sends a 500 when the request
  handler fails.
- Linux: file, folder and colour dialogs are in your language, numbers
  always use "." whatever your locale, and `startUpIconic` opens the
  stack minimised.
- Windows: while you compose Chinese, Japanese or Korean text, the
  caret and the candidate window sit where they should, and two
  programs asking for `the tempName` at the same time get different
  names.
- Standalone builder: a copied file inside the stack's folder keeps its
  subfolders in the standalone.
- Widgets and libraries: `the local date` has the right UTC offset on
  Windows and Linux; a foreign library that fails to load is named,
  with the reason; `execute script` says what went wrong; file saves on
  Windows check the write; the log of 0 throws a domain error; and a
  handler that couldn't be bound throws instead of crashing.

The standalone runtimes for the other platforms in each package are
built again for this release, so standalones for Windows and Linux get
these fixes too.

### xTalk Suite extensions

OXT-Beyond ships the extensions of the
[xTalk Suite](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/xtalk-suite) built
in, in the program's `Extensions` folder. They are taken from their own
repositories at pinned commits when OXT-Beyond is packaged (see
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#xtalk-suite-extensions)):

| Extension | What it is | Repository |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `org.openxtalk.library.sodium` | SodiumXT: modern cryptography through libsodium (authenticated encryption, Argon2id, X25519, ed25519, BLAKE2b, random bytes) | [SodiumXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/SodiumXT) |
| `org.openxtalk.library.torrent`, `torrentHelpers` | TorrentXT: BitTorrent and the DHT through libtorrent, and its script helpers | [TorrentXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/TorrentXT) |
| `org.openxtalk.library.enet`, `enetHelpers` | enetxt: reliable UDP networking through ENet, and its script helpers | [enetxt](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/enetxt) |
| `org.openxtalk.library.datachannel`, `dataChannelHelpers` | DataChannelXT: WebRTC data channels through libdatachannel, and its script helpers | [dataChannelXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/dataChannelXT) |
| `org.openxtalk.box2dxt`, `box2dxt-kit` | Box2Dxt: 2D physics through Box2D, and the Box2Dxt Kit | [Box2Dxt](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/Box2Dxt) |
| `org.openxtalk.library.coin`, `coinxt` | CoinXT: Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptography (hashes, keys, addresses, HD wallets, transactions) | [CoinXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/CoinXT) |
| `onionxt`, `onion-httpd` | OnionXT: Tor transport and onion services, and a small HTTP server on top of it (LiveCode Script) | [OnionXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OnionXT) |
| `nostrxt`, `nostr-relay` | NostrXT: the Nostr protocol and a relay client (LiveCode Script) | [NostrXT](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/NostrXT) |

- The IDE loads them when it starts, like its other built-in
  extensions; the *Extension Manager* lists them and can unload them or
  stop them loading. The script libraries are put into the message path
  when they load, so `start using stack "coinxt"` and the like, which
  the members' documentation mentions, are not needed in the IDE. They
  do no harm, because a stack name finds the built-in copy.
- The script libraries keep the stack names the members document
  (`coinxt`, `nostrxt`, `nostr-relay`, `onionxt`, `onion-httpd`,
  `box2dxt-kit`, `torrentHelpers`, `enetHelpers`, `dataChannelHelpers`),
  and only one stack of a given name can be in memory. While the
  built-in library is loaded, opening your own copy of the same file by
  its path, or loading it with
  `start using stack "<folder>/datachannel-helpers.livecodescript"`,
  makes the IDE ask what to do with the stack "already open". *Cancel*
  keeps the built-in copy in use; *Save* also writes the built-in copy
  back into the `Extensions` folder. In the IDE, load these libraries by
  name. To use your own copy instead, first unload the built-in one in
  the *Extension Manager* (and turn off "Load on startup" if it should
  stay unloaded).
- If you install your own copy of one of them (an `.lce` through the
  *Extension Manager*), the IDE loads your copy instead of the built-in
  one. For the LCB libraries this happens at once. For a script library
  it happens after you restart the IDE: until then the IDE asks about
  the stack "already open" (choose *Cancel*), and the built-in copy
  stays in use.
- For standalones, the standalone builder, when it searches for the
  inclusions a stack needs, adds an LCB library whose handlers your
  scripts use, together with its native library for the target platform.
  The extensions have native libraries for Windows x86-64 and x86, Linux
  x86-64 and x86, and macOS, but none for Android. The standalone builder
  never adds the script libraries by itself: tick them in *Standalone
  Settings*, with the LCB libraries they need (for example `coinxt` with
  `org.openxtalk.library.coin`).
- Their documentation is in their repositories (`docs/`); the Dictionary
  does not have it.
- Their licences (MIT, and those of the libraries built into them) are
  in each extension's `licenses` folder and in
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#xtalk-suite-extensions).

### The engine

The engine is the LiveCode Community **9.7 development tree** (the
upstream `develop` branch as it was left in July 2021, version
9.7.0-dp-1), not the 9.6.3 release, plus Tom Perry's OpenXTalk Lite
engine changes for Windows (commit `38d5712b2`) and, from 0.2.4-rc.4,
for macOS (his Apple Silicon working copy, as merged in
[OpenXTalk-Lite-1.15](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Lite-1.15)):

- **Windows dark mode.** Dark window title bars, dark system colours
  that update when the theme changes (with a `systemAppearanceChanged`
  message and a redraw of open stacks), and dark-mode aware checkmarks
  and cascade arrows.
- **Windows 11 detection.** The engine reports Windows 11 correctly.
- **`_internal respring`.** A development-engine command that restarts
  the IDE in place: it closes all stacks and reloads the home stack.
- **Faster script editor colourisation.** Colours and styles are set in
  one pass, and comment nesting is cached.
- **OneCore voices.** revSpeech (text to speech) lists the Windows
  OneCore voices.
- **No first-run licence dialog** in the development environment.
- **SQLite 3.51.1** (was 3.34.0) for the SQLite database driver.
- **Version 9.7.1-OXT**, build 25923 (see the `version` file). The
  engine version is separate from the OXT-Beyond product version in
  `ide/.version`.

**macOS dark mode and more.** On macOS the engine follows the Mac's
appearance and draws buttons, menus, scrollbars, progress bars, segmented
controls, sliders, group boxes and tab panes with AppKit
(`engine/src/osxtheme.mm`); window updates no longer wait for the Mac to
draw each one, and a `wait` or the end of a handler shows the latest
state; `macSetIcon` sets a file's Finder icon; and a few controls behave
as in his macOS release (radio buttons, scrollbars that hide when the
content fits, button labels 2 pixels higher). Where his two working
copies change the same engine file differently, the file holds both, in
`OXT-TOM` regions: macOS compiles his macOS lines, Windows and Linux his
Windows lines.

**Regular expressions** (`matchText`, `matchChunk`, `replaceText`)
follow the `caseSensitive` on every platform, as his shipped 1.15 engines
do.

Changes made in this repository to build it: the `thirdparty` and `ide`
submodules are ordinary folders in the repository, the prebuilt
third-party libraries are built from source (only LiveCode's CEF 74
archive for Windows, which LiveCode's server no longer provides, is
mirrored, in the
[`prebuilts-v1` release](https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond/releases/tag/prebuilts-v1)),
the build scripts were updated for Visual Studio 2022 with the v141
toolset, and GitHub Actions workflows build, package and test it for
Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Building from source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). In short: install Visual Studio 2022 with
the v141 toolset, Python 2.7, Strawberry Perl, Git and Cygwin, then

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/OpenXTalk-Beyond.git C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
cd /d C:\src\OpenXTalk-Beyond
set PATH=C:\Python27;%PATH%
C:\Python27\python.exe config.py --platform win-x86_64
cd build-win-x86_64
cmd /c ..\make.cmd
```

and run `win-x86_64-bin\LiveCode-Community.exe` from the repository.
To make the installed layout, the zips and the installer, see
[Package](BUILDING.md#package) and [Installer](BUILDING.md#installer)
(they need Python 3 and Inno Setup 6).

Linux and macOS are built by their CI workflows: BUILDING.md describes
their steps in [Building on Linux](BUILDING.md#12-building-on-linux) and
[Building on macOS](BUILDING.md#13-building-on-macos), and how a
release is made from a tag in
[Making a release](BUILDING.md#10-making-a-release).

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `engine/` | The engine: IDE ("development"), standalone, server and installer engines. |
| `libfoundation/`, `libgraphics/`, `libscript/`, `libcore/`, `libbrowser/`, `libexternal*/` | Libraries the engine is built from. |
| `rev*/` | Externals: database access (`revdb`), XML, zip, speech, PDF printing, browser and others. |
| `toolchain/` | The LiveCode Builder compiler (`lc-compile`) and runner (`lc-run`). |
| `extensions/` | Widgets and libraries written in LiveCode Builder, and script libraries. |
| `ide/` | The IDE: OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's IDE, with its history from Terry Little's .91 onwards (see [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)), and OXT-Beyond's changes. `ide/Extensions/` holds the extensions the IDE ships but this repository does not build. |
| `ide-support/` | Eleven IDE libraries kept in the engine repository (the standalone builder and others); they are installed into `Toolset/libraries`. |
| `docs/` | Dictionary, guides and release note fragments from LiveCode Community; development notes in `docs/development/`. |
| `thirdparty/` | Third-party library sources, vendored from `livecode/livecode-thirdparty`. |
| `prebuilt/` | Scripts that build the prebuilt third-party libraries from source (`build-libraries-windows.ps1` on Windows, `build-libraries.sh` on Linux and macOS) and fetch them for the build, with their versions and checksums; Windows' CEF 74 archive comes from the `prebuilts-v1` release. |
| `config/`, `gyp/`, `config.py`, `make.cmd` | Build configuration: gyp generates the Visual Studio projects. |
| `tools/oxt/` | Python tools that map an installed OpenXTalk Lite folder to the repository and back (`layout.py`), stage OXT-Beyond's installed layout (`package.py`), fetch the external assets listed in `external-assets.json`, pin, fetch and build the xTalk Suite extensions listed in `xtalk-extensions.json` (`xtalk_extensions.py`), and write the text dictionary's entries (`text_dictionary.py`). See [tools/oxt/README.md](tools/oxt/README.md). |
| `Installer/oxt-beyond/` | The Inno Setup script of the installer, the scripts that make its images, and the icon's source art. |
| `tools/ci/` | PowerShell, Python and shell scripts used by CI to install components, build, generate the dictionary and the guides (`build_docs.sh`), check, package, smoke-test, compile-check the IDE, run the engine tests of `tests/` (and trace a Windows crash), build and test the installer, join and sign the macOS app, test the Linux package, and assemble a release and its notes. |
| `.github/workflows/` | The GitHub Actions workflows: `build-windows.yml`, `build-macos.yml` and `build-linux.yml` build, package and test each platform on every push to `main` and every pull request into it; `docs.yml`, which each of them calls, generates the dictionary and the guides; `release.yml` builds all three from a `v` tag and publishes the release; `tag-release.yml` tags `main` and starts it; `runtimes.yml` makes the standalone runtimes asset; `media-check.yml` checks the browser and player in a published release. |
| `Installer/package.txt`, `builder/` | LiveCode's packaging manifest (the packager follows its rules for Windows, Linux and macOS) and LiveCode's build tools, whose docs builder makes the dictionary and the guides (its installer builder is not used). |
| `tests/`, `engine/exec-tests/` and others | Upstream test suites; CI runs those of `tests/` (see [Engine tests](BUILDING.md#engine-tests)). |

For a compatibility-first proposal to make the engine easier to test and
change, see the [engine stabilization and modernization plan](docs/development/engine-modernization-plan.md).

## Known limitations and plans

Known limitations, in rough order of importance:

1. Old third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities: CEF/Chromium
   74 and several older libraries in `thirdparty/`. (OpenSSL, curl,
   ICU, zlib, libpng, giflib, libjpeg and PCRE are current from
   0.2.1-rc.3 on.) Plan: update them too.
2. The Android standalone runtime is OpenXTalk Lite 1.15's (LiveCode
   Community 9.6.3 builds), not built from this repository, and Android
   standalones are not tested automatically. The Windows and Linux
   runtimes are built from this repository from 0.2.1-rc.3 on, and every
   package's tests build a standalone from each of them. Plan: build the
   Android engine here too.
3. The Windows binaries are not code-signed, and the macOS app is signed
   ad hoc, not with an Apple Developer ID, and not notarized. Plan:
   Developer ID signing and notarization for macOS.
4. "OpenXTalk Lite" still appears inside binary stacks, and the build
   output files are named after LiveCode. Plan: change the binary stacks
   a few at a time with the stack patches of `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches`
   (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#11-working-on-the-ide)), and rename the
   engine files.
5. Legacy toolchain (v141, Python 2.7, Cygwin). Plan: move to the current
   Visual Studio toolset and Python 3.
6. The mergExt externals are not included.
7. It has not been confirmed that Tom Perry and the other OpenXTalk Lite
   contributors offer their changes with LiveCode's permission to combine
   the code with ATL (see [LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md](LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md)).
   OpenSSL no longer needs that permission: from 0.2.1-rc.3 on,
   OXT-Beyond ships OpenSSL 3, under the Apache License 2.0, which the
   GPLv3 is compatible with.
8. Dictionary favourites and notes, custom script editor colours and
   recent-stack thumbnails are shared with OpenXTalk Lite, and the
   engine writes its licence file into LiveCode's `RunRev` folder (see
   [Where OXT-Beyond keeps your files](#where-oxt-beyond-keeps-your-files)).
   Plan: move them to OXT-Beyond's folders when the binary stacks are
   changed, and in the engine.
9. Dark mode is Tom Perry's. On Windows it has the readability problems
   OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 had (disabled labels drawn engraved, light
   scrollbars, light native controls on dark windows). Linux is drawn
   light. His macOS dark mode has been built and tested in CI but not yet
   tried on a Mac. OXT-Beyond's own dark mode work continues in a
   separate, experimental repository.
10. The player depends on what the system can play. On Windows it uses
   DirectShow, which cannot open MP4 (H.264 and AAC) files without a
   third-party DirectShow filter such as LAV Filters; AVI files play.
   On Linux it runs mplayer, which must be installed (`sudo apt install
   mplayer` on Debian and Ubuntu); without it no file plays. macOS
   plays both. A Media Foundation player for Windows would open MP4
   files by itself; whether to write one is not decided yet.
11. In an install for all users, a few things that save stacks inside
   the program folder fail for standard users, because Setup keeps
   stacks and scripts there read-only: the Report Builder plugin saving
   itself when it closes, *Plugin Settings* changes to the plugins that
   come with OXT-Beyond, and edits to the built-in image libraries. Install for the current user only,
   or use the portable zip, if you need them. Plan: keep that state in
   the user's own folders.

Done since 0.0.1: the extensions of the xTalk Suite are built in, taken
from their own repositories at pinned commits (see
[xTalk Suite extensions](#xtalk-suite-extensions) and
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#xtalk-suite-extensions)). Their limitations:
the native libraries are the members' prebuilt binaries, which
OXT-Beyond checks but does not build; the Dictionary does not have
their documentation; the standalone builder does not add the script
libraries by itself; and enetxt and Box2Dxt need the Visual C++ runtime,
whose DLLs the Windows packages ship next to them (the Linux and macOS
packages do not yet).

Issues and pull requests for any of these are welcome.
